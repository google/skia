THE ORIGINS OF THE Portable Document Format and the Adobe® Acrobat®
product family date to early 1990. At that time, the PostScript® page description
language was rapidly becoming the worldwide standard for the production of the
printed page. PDF builds on the PostScript page description language by layering
a document structure and interactive navigation features on PostScript’s under-
lying imaging model, providing a convenient, efﬁcient mechanism enabling doc-
uments to be reliably viewed and printed anywhere.
The PDF speciﬁcation was ﬁrst published at the same time the ﬁrst Acrobat prod-
ucts were introduced in 1993. Since then, updated versions of the speciﬁcation
have been and continue to be available from Adobe via the World Wide Web. This
book is the third professionally published edition of the speciﬁcation. Like its
predecessor, it is completely self-contained, including the precise documentation
of the underlying imaging model from PostScript along with the PDF-speciﬁc
features that are combined in version 1.4 of the PDF standard.
Over the past eight years, aided by the explosive growth of the Internet, PDF has
become the de facto standard for the electronic exchange of documents. Well over
200 million copies of the free Acrobat Reader® application have been distributed
around the world, facilitating efﬁcient sharing of digital content. In addition,
PDF is now the industry standard for the intermediate representation of printed
material in electronic prepress systems for conventional printing applications. As
major corporations, government agencies, and educational institutions stream-
line their operations by replacing paper-based workﬂow with electronic exchange
of information, the impact and opportunity for the application of PDF will con-
tinue to grow at a rapid pace.
PDF is the ﬁle format that underlies Adobe ePaper® Solutions, a family of prod-
ucts supporting Adobe’s vision for Network Publishing—the process of creating,
managing, and accessing digital content on diverse platforms and devices. ePaper
                                         xix
fulﬁlls a set of requirements related to business process needs for the global desk-
top user, including:
• Preservation of document ﬁdelity across the enterprise, independently of the
  device, platform, and software
• Merging of content from diverse sources—Web sites, word processing and
  spreadsheet programs, scanned documents, photos, and graphics—into one
  self-contained document while maintaining the integrity of all original source
  documents
• Real-time collaborative editing of documents from multiple locations or plat-
  forms
• Digital signatures to certify authenticity
• Security and permissions to allow the creator to retain control of the document
  and associated rights
• Accessibility of content to those with disabilities
• Extraction and reuse of content using other ﬁle formats and applications
A signiﬁcant number of third-party developers and systems integrators offer cus-
tomized enhancements and extensions to Adobe’s core family of products. Adobe
publishes the PDF speciﬁcation in order to encourage the development of such
third-party applications.
The emergence of PDF as a standard for electronic information exchange is the
result of concerted effort by many individuals in both the private and public sec-
tors. Without the dedication of Adobe employees, our industry partners, and our
customers, the widespread acceptance of PDF could not have been achieved. We
thank all of you for your continuing support and creative contributions to the
success of PDF.

                              1Introduction
    THE ADOBE PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT (PDF) is the native ﬁle for-
    mat of the Adobe® Acrobat® family of products. The goal of these products is to
    enable users to exchange and view electronic documents easily and reliably, inde-
    pendently of the environment in which they were created. PDF relies on the same
    imaging model as the PostScript® page description language to describe text and
    graphics in a device-independent and resolution-independent manner. To im-
    prove performance for interactive viewing, PDF deﬁnes a more structured format
    than that used by most PostScript language programs. PDF also includes objects,
    such as annotations and hypertext links, that are not part of the page itself but are
    useful for interactive viewing and document interchange.
1.1 About This Book
    This book provides a description of the PDF ﬁle format and is intended primarily
    for application developers wishing to develop PDF producer applications that cre-
    ate PDF ﬁles directly. It also contains enough information to allow developers to
    write PDF consumer applications that read existing PDF ﬁles and interpret or
    modify their contents.
    Although the PDF speciﬁcation is independent of any particular software imple-
    mentation, some PDF features are best explained by describing the way they are
    processed by a typical application program. In such cases, this book uses the
    Adobe Acrobat family of PDF viewer applications as its model. (The prototypical
    viewer is the fully capable Acrobat product, not the limited Acrobat Reader®
    product.) Similarly, Appendix C discusses some implementation limits in the
    Acrobat viewer applications, even though these limits are not part of the ﬁle for-
    mat itself. To provide guidance to implementors of PDF producer and consumer
    applications, compatibility and implementation notes in Appendix H describe
                                              1
the behavior of Acrobat viewer applications when they encounter newer features
they do not understand, as well as areas in which the Acrobat products diverge
from the speciﬁcation presented in this book.
This third edition of the PDF Reference describes version 1.4 of PDF. (See imple-
mentation note 1 in Appendix H.) Throughout the book, information speciﬁc to
particular versions of PDF is marked as such—for example, with indicators like
(PDF 1.3) or (PDF 1.4). Features so marked may be new in the indicated version
or may have been substantially redeﬁned in that version. Features designated
(PDF 1.0) have generally been superseded in later versions; unless otherwise stat-
ed, features identiﬁed as speciﬁc to other versions are understood to be available
in later versions as well. (PDF viewer applications designed for a speciﬁc PDF
version generally ignore newer features they do not recognize; implementation
notes in Appendix H point out exceptions.)
The rest of the book is organized as follows:
• Chapter 2, “Overview,” brieﬂy introduces the overall architecture of PDF and
  the design considerations behind it, compares it with the PostScript language,
  and describes the underlying imaging model that they share.
• Chapter 3, “Syntax,” presents the syntax of PDF at the object, ﬁle, and docu-
  ment level. It sets the stage for subsequent chapters, which describe how that
  information is interpreted as page descriptions, interactive navigational aids,
  and application-level logical structure.
• Chapter 4, “Graphics,” describes the graphics operators used to describe the
  appearance of pages in a PDF document.
• Chapter 5, “Text,” discusses PDF’s special facilities for presenting text in the
  form of character shapes, or glyphs, deﬁned by fonts.
• Chapter 6, “Rendering,” considers how device-independent content descrip-
  tions are matched to the characteristics of a particular output device.
• Chapter 7, “Transparency,” discusses the operation of the transparent imaging
  model, introduced in PDF 1.4, in which objects can be painted with varying
  degrees of opacity, allowing the previous contents of the page to show through.
• Chapter 8, “Interactive Features,” describes those features of PDF that allow a
  user to interact with a document on the screen, using the mouse and keyboard.
• Chapter 9, “Document Interchange,” shows how PDF documents can incorpo-
  rate higher-level information that is useful for the interchange of documents
  among applications.
The appendices contain useful tables and other auxiliary information.
• Appendix A, “Operator Summary,” lists all the operators used in describing the
  visual content of a PDF document.
• Appendix B, “Operators in Type 4 Functions,” summarizes the PostScript oper-
  ators that can be used in PostScript calculator functions, which contain code
  written in a small subset of the PostScript language.
• Appendix C, “Implementation Limits,” describes typical size and quantity
  limits imposed by the Acrobat viewer applications.
• Appendix D, “Character Sets and Encodings,” lists the character sets and en-
  codings that are assumed to be predeﬁned in any PDF viewer application.
• Appendix E, “PDF Name Registry,” discusses a registry, maintained for devel-
  opers by Adobe Systems, that contains private names and formats used by PDF
  producers or Acrobat plug-in extensions.
• Appendix F, “Linearized PDF,” describes a special form of PDF ﬁle organiza-
  tion designed to work efﬁciently in network environments.
• Appendix G, “Example PDF Files,” presents several examples showing the
  structure of actual PDF ﬁles, ranging from one containing a minimal one-page
  document to one showing how the structure of a PDF ﬁle evolves over the
  course of several revisions.
• Appendix H, “Compatibility and Implementation Notes,” provides details on
  the behavior of Acrobat viewer applications and describes how viewer applica-
  tions should handle PDF ﬁles containing features that they do not recognize.
A color plate section provides illustrations of some of PDF’s color-related fea-
tures. References in the text of the form “see Plate 1” refer to the contents of this
section.
The book concludes with a Bibliography and an Index.

1.2 Introduction to PDF 1.4 Features
    The most signiﬁcant addition in PDF 1.4 is the new transparent imaging model,
    which extends the opaque imaging model of earlier versions to include the ability
    to paint objects with varying degrees of opacity, allowing previously painted
    objects to show through. Transparency is covered primarily in Chapter 7, with
    implications reﬂected in other chapters as well. Other new features introduced in
    PDF 1.4 include the following:
    • A ﬁlter for decoding JBIG2-encoded data (Section 3.3.6, “JBIG2Decode Filter”)
    • Enhancements to encryption (Section 3.5, “Encryption”)
    • Speciﬁcation of the PDF version in the document catalog (Section 3.6.1, “Doc-
      ument Catalog”)
    • Embedding of data in a ﬁle stream (Section 3.10.3, “Embedded File Streams”)
    • The ability to import content from one PDF document into another (Section
      4.9.3, “Reference XObjects”)
    • New predeﬁned CMaps (“Predeﬁned CMaps” on page 343)
    • Additional viewer preferences for controlling the area of a page to be displayed
      or printed (Section 8.1, “Viewer Preferences”)
    • Speciﬁcation of a color and font style for text in an outline item (Section 8.2.2,
      “Document Outline”)
    • Annotation names (Section 8.4, “Annotations”) and new entries in speciﬁc
      annotation dictionaries (Section 8.4.1, “Annotation Dictionaries”)
    • Additional trigger events for actions affecting the document as a whole (Sec-
      tion 8.5.2, “Trigger Events”)
    • Assorted enhancements to interactive forms and Forms Data Format (FDF),
      including multiple-selection list boxes, ﬁle-select controls, XML form submis-
      sion, embedded FDF ﬁles, Unicode® speciﬁcation of ﬁeld export values, and
      support for remote collaboration and digital signatures in FDF ﬁles (Section
      8.6, “Interactive Forms”)
    • Metadata streams, a new architecture for attaching descriptive information to
      PDF documents and their constituent parts (Section 9.2.2, “Metadata
      Streams”)
    • Standardized structure types and attributes for describing the logical structure
      of a document (Section 9.7, “Tagged PDF”)
    • Support for accessibility to disabled users, including speciﬁcation of the lan-
      guage used for text (Section 9.8, “Accessibility Support”)
    • Support for the display and preview of production-related page boundaries
      such as the crop box, bleed box, and trim box (Section 9.10.1, “Page Bound-
      aries”)
    • Facilities for including printer’s marks such as registration targets, gray ramps,
      color bars, and cut marks to assist in the production process (Section 9.10.2,
      “Printer’s Marks”)
    • Output intents for matching the color characteristics of a document with those
      of a target output device or production environment in which it will be printed
      (Section 9.10.4, “Output Intents”)
1.3 Related Publications
    PDF and the PostScript page description language share the same underlying
    Adobe imaging model. A document can be converted straightforwardly between
    PDF and the PostScript language; the two representations produce the same out-
    put when printed. However, PostScript includes a general-purpose programming
    language framework not present in PDF. The PostScript Language Reference is the
    comprehensive reference for the PostScript language and its imaging model.
    PDF and PostScript support several standard formats for font programs, includ-
    ing Adobe Type 1, CFF (Compact Font Format), TrueType®, and CID-keyed
    fonts. The PDF manifestations of these fonts are documented in this book. How-
    ever, the speciﬁcations for the font ﬁles themselves are published separately,
    because they are highly specialized and are of interest to a different user commu-
    nity. A variety of Adobe publications are available on the subject of font formats,
    most notably the following:
    • Adobe Type 1 Font Format and Adobe Technical Note #5015, Type 1 Font Format
      Supplement
    • Adobe Technical Note #5176, The Compact Font Format Speciﬁcation
    • Adobe Technical Note #5177, The Type 2 Charstring Format
    • Adobe Technical Note #5014, Adobe CMap and CID Font Files Speciﬁcation

    of this book.
1.4 Intellectual Property
    The general idea of using an interchange format for electronic documents is in
    the public domain. Anyone is free to devise a set of unique data structures and
    operators that deﬁne an interchange format for electronic documents. However,
    Adobe Systems Incorporated owns the copyright for the particular data struc-
    tures and operators and the written speciﬁcation constituting the interchange
    format called the Portable Document Format. Thus, these elements of the Port-
    able Document Format may not be copied without Adobe’s permission.
    Adobe will enforce its copyright. Adobe’s intention is to maintain the integrity of
    the Portable Document Format standard. This enables the public to distinguish
    between the Portable Document Format and other interchange formats for elec-
    tronic documents. However, Adobe desires to promote the use of the Portable
    Document Format for information interchange among diverse products and
    applications. Accordingly, Adobe gives anyone copyright permission, subject to
    the conditions stated below, to:
    • Prepare ﬁles whose content conforms to the Portable Document Format
    • Write drivers and applications that produce output represented in the Portable
      Document Format
    • Write software that accepts input in the form of the Portable Document
      Format and displays, prints, or otherwise interprets the contents
    • Copy Adobe’s copyrighted list of data structures and operators, as well as the
      example code and PostScript language function deﬁnitions in the written
      speciﬁcation, to the extent necessary to use the Portable Document Format for
      the purposes above
    The conditions of such copyright permission are:
    • Software that accepts input in the form of the Portable Document Format must
      respect the access permissions speciﬁed in that document. Accessing the docu-
  ment in ways not permitted by the document’s access permissions is a violation
  of the document author’s copyright.
• Anyone who uses the copyrighted list of data structures and operators, as stated
  above, must include an appropriate copyright notice.
This limited right to use the copyrighted list of data structures and operators
does not include the right to copy this book, other copyrighted material from
Adobe, or the software in any of Adobe’s products that use the Portable Docu-
ment Format, in whole or in part, nor does it include the right to use any Adobe
patents, except as may be permitted by an ofﬁcial Adobe Patent Clariﬁcation
Notice (see the Bibliography).

                              2Overview
THE ADOBE PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT (PDF) is a ﬁle format for rep-
resenting documents in a manner independent of the application software, hard-
ware, and operating system used to create them and of the output device on
which they are to be displayed or printed. A PDF document consists of a collec-
tion of objects that together describe the appearance of one or more pages, possi-
bly accompanied by additional interactive elements and higher-level application
data. A PDF ﬁle contains the objects making up a PDF document along with
associated structural information, all represented as a single self-contained se-
quence of bytes.
A document’s pages (and other visual elements) may contain any combination of
text, graphics, and images. A page’s appearance is described by a PDF content
stream, which contains a sequence of graphics objects to be painted on the page.
This appearance is fully speciﬁed; all layout and formatting decisions have al-
ready been made by the application generating the content stream.
In addition to describing the static appearance of pages, a PDF document may
contain interactive elements that are possible only in an electronic representa-
tion. PDF supports annotations of many kinds for such things as text notes,
hypertext links, markup, ﬁle attachments, sounds, and movies. A document can
deﬁne its own user interface; keyboard and mouse input can trigger actions that
are speciﬁed by PDF objects. The document can contain interactive form ﬁelds to
be ﬁlled in by the user, and can export the values of these ﬁelds to or import them
from other applications.
Finally, a PDF document can contain higher-level information that is useful for
interchange of content among applications. In addition to specifying appearance,
a document’s content can include identiﬁcation and logical structure informa-
                                          9
      tion that allows it to be searched, edited, or extracted for reuse elsewhere. PDF is
      particularly well suited for representing a document as it moves through succes-
      sive stages of a prepress production workﬂow.
 2.1 Imaging Model
      At the heart of PDF is its ability to describe the appearance of sophisticated
      graphics and typography. This is achieved through the use of the Adobe imaging
      model, the same high-level, device-independent representation used in the Post-
      Script page description language.
      Although application programs could theoretically describe any page as a full-
      resolution pixel array, the resulting ﬁle would be bulky, device-dependent, and
      impractical for high-resolution devices. A high-level imaging model enables
      applications to describe the appearance of pages containing text, graphical
      shapes, and sampled images in terms of abstract graphical elements rather than
      directly in terms of device pixels. Such a description is economical and device-
      independent, and can be used to produce high-quality output on a broad range
      of printers, displays, and other output devices.
2.1.1 Page Description Languages
      Among its other roles, PDF serves as a page description language: a language for
      describing the graphical appearance of pages with respect to an imaging model.
      An application program produces output through a two-stage process:
      1. The application generates a device-independent description of the desired
         output in the page description language.
      2. A program controlling a speciﬁc output device interprets the description and
         renders it on that device.
      The two stages may be executed in different places and at different times; the page
      description language serves as an interchange standard for the compact, device-
      independent transmission and storage of printable or displayable documents.
2.1.2 Adobe Imaging Model
      The Adobe imaging model is a simple and uniﬁed view of two-dimensional
      graphics borrowed from the graphic arts. In this model, “paint” is placed on a
      page in selected areas.
      • The painted ﬁgures may be in the form of character shapes (glyphs), geometric
         shapes, lines, or sampled images such as digital representations of photo-
         graphs.
      • The paint may be in color or in black, white, or any shade of gray; it may also
         take the form of a repeating pattern (PDF 1.2) or a smooth transition between
         colors (PDF 1.3).
      • Any of these elements may be clipped to appear within other shapes as they are
         placed onto the page.
      A page’s content stream contains operands and operators describing a sequence of
      graphics objects. A PDF viewer application maintains an implicit current page
      that accumulates the marks made by the painting operators. Initially, the current
      page is completely blank. For each graphics object encountered in the content
      stream, the viewer places marks on the current page, which replace or combine
      with any previous marks they may overlay. Once the page has been completely
      composed, the accumulated marks are rendered on the output medium and the
      current page is cleared to blank again.
      Versions of PDF up to and including PDF 1.3 use an opaque imaging model in
      which each new graphics object painted onto a page completely obscures the pre-
      vious contents of the page at those locations (subject to the effects of certain op-
      tional parameters that may modify this behavior; see Section 4.5.6, “Overprint
      Control”). No matter what color an object has—white, black, gray, or color—it is
      placed on the page as if it were applied with opaque paint. PDF 1.4 introduces a
      new transparent imaging model in which objects painted on the page are not
      required to be fully opaque. Instead, newly painted objects are composited with
      the previously existing contents of the page, producing results that combine the
      colors of the object and its backdrop according to their respective opacity charac-
      teristics. The transparent imaging model is described in Chapter 7.
      The principal graphics objects (among others) are as follows:
      • A path object consists of a sequence of connected and disconnected points,
        lines, and curves that together describe shapes and their positions. It is built up
        through the sequential application of path construction operators, each of which
        appends one or more new elements. The path object is ended by a path-
        painting operator, which paints the path on the page in some way. The principal
        path-painting operators are S (stroke), which paints a line along the path, and f
        (ﬁll), which paints the interior of the path.
      • A text object consists of one or more glyph shapes representing characters of
        text. The glyph shapes for the characters are described in a separate data struc-
        ture called a font. Like path objects, text objects can be stroked or ﬁlled.
      • An image object is a rectangular array of sample values, each representing a
        color at a particular position within the rectangle. Such objects are typically
        used to represent photographs.
      The painting operators require various parameters, some explicit and others im-
      plicit. Implicit parameters include the current color, current line width, current
      font (typeface and size), and many others. Together, these implicit parameters
      make up the graphics state. There are operators for setting the value of each im-
      plicit parameter in the graphics state; painting operators use the values currently
      in effect at the time they are invoked.
      One additional implicit parameter in the graphics state modiﬁes the results of
      painting graphics objects. The current clipping path outlines the area of the cur-
      rent page within which paint can be placed. Although painting operators may
      attempt to place marks anywhere on the current page, only those marks falling
      within the current clipping path will affect the page; those falling outside it will
      not. Initially, the current clipping path encompasses the entire imageable area of
      the page. It can temporarily be reduced to the shape deﬁned by a path or text ob-
      ject, or to the intersection of multiple such shapes. Marks placed by subsequent
      painting operators will then be conﬁned within that boundary.
2.1.3 Raster Output Devices
      Much of the power of the Adobe imaging model derives from its ability to deal
      with the general class of raster output devices. These encompass such technologies
      as laser, dot-matrix, and ink-jet printers, digital imagesetters, and raster-scan
      displays. The deﬁning property of a raster output device is that a printed or dis-
      played image consists of a rectangular array, or raster, of dots called pixels (picture
      elements) that can be addressed individually. On a typical bilevel output device,
      each pixel can be made either black or white. On some devices, pixels can be set
      to intermediate shades of gray or to some color. The ability to set the colors of
      individual pixels makes it possible to generate printed or displayed output that
      can include text, arbitrary graphical shapes, and reproductions of sampled
      images.
      The resolution of a raster output device measures the number of pixels per unit of
      distance along the two linear dimensions. Resolution is typically—but not neces-
      sarily—the same horizontally and vertically. Manufacturers’ decisions on device
      technology and price/performance tradeoffs create characteristic ranges of reso-
      lution:
      • Computer displays have relatively low resolution, typically 75 to 110 pixels per
        inch.
      • Dot-matrix printers generally range from 100 to 250 pixels per inch.
      • Ink-jet and laser-scanned xerographic printing technologies achieve medium-
        level resolutions of 300 to 1400 pixels per inch.
      • Photographic technology permits high resolutions of 2400 pixels per inch or
        more.
      Higher resolution yields better quality and ﬁdelity of the resulting output, but is
      achieved at greater cost. As the technology improves and computing costs de-
      crease, products evolve to higher resolutions.
2.1.4 Scan Conversion
      An abstract graphical element (such as a line, a circle, a character glyph, or a
      sampled image) is rendered on a raster output device by a process known as scan
      conversion. Given a mathematical description of the graphical element, this pro-
      cess determines which pixels to adjust and what values to assign to those pixels to
      achieve the most faithful rendition possible at the available device resolution.
      The pixels on a page can be represented by a two-dimensional array of pixel
      values in computer memory. For an output device whose pixels can only be black
      or white, a single bit sufﬁces to represent each pixel. For a device that can repro-
      duce gray levels or colors, multiple bits per pixel are required.
      Note: Although the ultimate representation of a printed or displayed page is logically
      a complete array of pixels, its actual representation in computer memory need not
      consist of one memory cell per pixel. Some implementations use other representa-
      tions, such as display lists. The Adobe imaging model has been carefully designed not
      to depend on any particular representation of raster memory.
      For each graphical element that is to appear on the page, the scan converter sets
      the values of the corresponding pixels. When the interpretation of the page de-
      scription is complete, the pixel values in memory represent the appearance of the
      page. At this point, a raster output process can render this representation (make it
      visible) on a printed page or display screen.
      Scan-converting a graphical shape, such as a rectangle or circle, entails determin-
      ing which device pixels lie inside the shape and setting their values appropriately
      (for example, to black). Because the edges of a shape do not always fall precisely
      on the boundaries between pixels, some policy is required for deciding how to set
      the pixels along the edges. Scan-converting a glyph representing a text character
      is conceptually the same as scan-converting an arbitrary graphical shape; how-
      ever, character glyphs are much more sensitive to legibility requirements and
      must meet more rigid objective and subjective measures of quality.
      Rendering grayscale elements on a bilevel device is accomplished by a technique
      known as halftoning. The array of pixels is divided into small clusters according to
      some pattern (called the halftone screen). Within each cluster, some pixels are set
      to black and some to white in proportion to the level of gray desired at that loca-
      tion on the page. When viewed from a sufﬁcient distance, the individual dots be-
      come imperceptible and the perceived result is a shade of gray. This enables a
      bilevel raster output device to reproduce shades of gray and to approximate natu-
      ral images such as photographs. Some color devices use a similar technique.
 2.2 Other General Properties
      This section describes other notable general properties of PDF, aside from its im-
      aging model.
2.2.1 Portability
      PDF ﬁles are represented as sequences of 8-bit binary bytes. A PDF ﬁle is de-
      signed to be portable across all platforms and operating systems. The binary rep-
      resentation is intended to be generated, transported, and consumed directly,
      without translation between native character sets, end-of-line representations, or
      other conventions used on various platforms.
      Any PDF ﬁle can also be represented in a form that uses only 7-bit ASCII (Ameri-
      can Standard Code for Information Interchange) character codes. This is useful
      for the purpose of exposition, as in this book. However, this representation is not
      recommended for actual use, since it is less efﬁcient than the normal binary rep-
      resentation. Regardless of which representation is used, PDF ﬁles must be trans-
      ported and stored as binary ﬁles, not as text ﬁles; inadvertent changes, such as
      conversion between text end-of-line conventions, will damage the ﬁle and may
      render it unusable.
2.2.2 Compression
      To reduce ﬁle size, PDF supports a number of industry-standard compression
      ﬁlters:
      • JPEG compression of color and grayscale images
      • CCITT (Group 3 or Group 4), run-length, and (in PDF 1.4) JBIG2 compres-
        sion of monochrome images
      • LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) and (beginning with PDF 1.2) Flate compression of
        text, graphics, and images
      Using JPEG compression, color and grayscale images can be compressed by a fac-
      tor of 10 or more. Effective compression of monochrome images depends on the
      compression ﬁlter used and the properties of the image, but reductions of 2:1 to
      8:1 are common (or 20:1 to 50:1 for JBIG2 compression of an image of a page full
      of text). LZW or Flate compression of the content streams describing all other
      text and graphics in the document results in compression ratios of approximately
      2:1. All of these compression ﬁlters produce binary data, which can then be
      further converted to ASCII base-85 encoding if a 7-bit ASCII representation is
      desired.
2.2.3 Font Management
      Managing fonts is a fundamental challenge in document interchange. Generally,
      the receiver of a document must have the same fonts that were originally used to
create it. If a different font is substituted, its character set, glyph shapes, and met-
rics may differ from those in the original font. This can produce unexpected and
undesirable results, such as lines of text extending into margins or overlapping
with graphics.
PDF provides various means for dealing with font management:
• The original font programs can be embedded in the PDF ﬁle. PDF supports
   various font formats, including Type 1, TrueType®, and CID-keyed fonts. This
   ensures the most predictable and dependable results.
• To conserve space, a font subset can be embedded, containing just the glyph
   descriptions for those characters that are actually used in the document. Also,
   Type 1 fonts can be represented in a special compact format.
• PDF prescribes a set of 14 standard fonts that can be used without prior deﬁni-
   tion. These include four faces each of three Latin text typefaces (Courier,
   Helvetica*, and Times*), as well as two symbolic fonts (Symbol and ITC Zapf
   Dingbats®). These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, are
   guaranteed to be available in all PDF viewer applications.
• A PDF ﬁle can refer by name to fonts that are not embedded in the PDF ﬁle. In
   this case, a viewer application will use those fonts if they are available in the
   viewer’s environment. This approach suffers from the uncertainties noted
   above.
• A PDF ﬁle contains a font descriptor for each font that it uses (other than the
   standard 14). The font descriptor includes font metrics and style information,
   enabling a viewer application to select or synthesize a suitable substitute font if
   necessary. Although the glyphs’ shapes will differ from those intended, their
   placement will be accurate.
Font management is primarily concerned with producing the correct appearance
of text—that is, the shape and placement of glyphs. However, it is sometimes
necessary for a PDF application to extract the meaning of the text, represented in
some standard information encoding such as Unicode. In some cases, this in-
formation can be deduced from the encoding used to represent the text in the
PDF ﬁle. Otherwise, the PDF producer application should specify the mapping
explicitly by including a special object, the ToUnicode CMap.
2.2.4 Single-Pass File Generation
      Because of system limitations and efﬁciency considerations, it may be necessary
      or desirable for an application program to generate a PDF ﬁle in a single pass. For
      example, the program may have limited memory available or be unable to open
      temporary ﬁles. For this reason, PDF supports single-pass generation of ﬁles.
      Although some PDF objects must specify their length in bytes, a mechanism is
      provided allowing the length to follow the object itself in the PDF ﬁle. In addi-
      tion, information such as the number of pages in the document can be written
      into the ﬁle after all pages have been generated.
      A PDF ﬁle that is generated in a single pass is generally not ordered for most efﬁ-
      cient viewing, particularly when accessing the contents of the ﬁle over a network.
      When generating a PDF ﬁle that is intended to be viewed many times, it is worth-
      while to perform a second pass to optimize the order in which objects occur in
      the ﬁle. PDF speciﬁes a particular ﬁle organization, Linearized PDF, which is doc-
      umented in Appendix F. Other optimizations are also possible, such as detecting
      duplicated sequences of graphics objects and collapsing them to a single shared
      sequence that is speciﬁed only once.
2.2.5 Random Access
      A PDF ﬁle should be thought of as a ﬂattened representation of a data structure
      consisting of a collection of objects that can refer to each other in any arbitrary
      way. The order of the objects’ occurrence in the PDF ﬁle has no semantic signiﬁ-
      cance. In general, a viewer application should process a PDF ﬁle by following ref-
      erences from object to object, rather than by processing objects sequentially. This
      is particularly important for interactive document viewing or for any application
      in which pages or other objects in the PDF ﬁle are accessed out of sequence.
      To support such random access to individual objects, every PDF ﬁle contains a
      cross-reference table that can be used to locate and directly access pages and other
      important objects within the ﬁle. The cross-reference table is stored at the end of
      the ﬁle, allowing applications that generate PDF ﬁles in a single pass to store it
      easily and those that read PDF ﬁles to locate it easily. Using the cross-reference
      table makes the time needed to locate a page or other object nearly independent
      of the length of the document. This allows PDF documents containing hundreds
      or thousands of pages to be accessed efﬁciently.
2.2.6 Security
      PDF has two security features that can be used, separately or together, in any doc-
      ument:
      • The document can be encrypted so that only authorized users can access it.
        There is separate authorization for the owner of the document and for all other
        users; the users’ access can be selectively restricted to allow only certain opera-
        tions, such as viewing, printing, or editing.
      • The document can be digitally signed to certify its authenticity. The signature
        may take many forms, including a document digest that has been encrypted
        with a public/private key, a biometric signature such as a ﬁngerprint, and oth-
        ers. Any subsequent changes to a signed PDF ﬁle will invalidate the signature.
2.2.7 Incremental Update
      Applications may allow users to modify PDF documents. Users should not have
      to wait for the entire ﬁle—which can contain hundreds of pages or more—to be
      rewritten each time modiﬁcations to the document are saved. PDF allows modiﬁ-
      cations to be appended to a ﬁle, leaving the original data intact. The addendum
      appended when a ﬁle is incrementally updated contains only those objects that
      were actually added or modiﬁed, and includes an update to the cross-reference
      table. Incremental update allows an application to save modiﬁcations to a PDF
      document in an amount of time proportional to the size of the modiﬁcation
      rather than the size of the ﬁle.
      In addition, because the original contents of the document are still present in the
      ﬁle, it is possible to undo saved changes by deleting one or more addenda. The
      ability to recover the exact contents of an original document is critical when digi-
      tal signatures have been applied and subsequently need to be veriﬁed.
2.2.8 Extensibility
      PDF is designed to be extensible. Not only can new features be added, but appli-
      cations based on earlier versions of PDF can behave reasonably when they en-
      counter newer features that they do not understand. Appendix H describes how a
      PDF viewer application should behave in such cases.
    Additionally, PDF provides means for applications to store their own private in-
    formation in a PDF ﬁle. This information can be recovered when the ﬁle is im-
    ported by the same application, but is ignored by other applications. This allows
    PDF to serve as an application’s native ﬁle format while allowing its documents to
    be viewed and printed by other applications. Application-speciﬁc data can be
    stored either as marked content annotating the graphics objects in a PDF content
    stream or as entirely separate objects unconnected with the PDF content.
2.3 Using PDF
    PDF ﬁles may be produced either directly by application programs or indirectly
    by conversion from other ﬁle formats or imaging models. As PDF documents and
    applications that process them become more prevalent, new ways of creating and
    using PDF will be invented. One of the goals of this book is to make the ﬁle for-
    mat accessible so that application developers can expand on the ideas behind
    PDF and the applications that initially support it.
    Many applications can generate PDF ﬁles directly, and some can import them as
    well. This is the most desirable approach, since it gives the application access to
    the full capabilities of PDF, including the imaging model and the interactive and
    document interchange features. Alternatively, existing applications that do not
    generate PDF directly can still be used to produce PDF output by indirect meth-
    ods. There are two principal ways of doing this:
    • The application describes its printable output by making calls to an application
       programming interface (API) such as GDI in Microsoft® Windows® or Quick-
       Draw® in the Apple® Mac® OS. A software component called a printer driver in-
       tercepts these calls and interprets them to generate output in PDF form.
    • The application produces printable output directly in some other ﬁle format,
       such as PostScript, PCL, HPGL, or DVI, which is then converted into PDF by a
       separate translation program.
    Note, however, that while these indirect strategies are often the easiest way to ob-
    tain PDF output from an existing application, the resulting PDF ﬁles may not
    make the best use of the high-level Adobe imaging model. This is because the in-
    formation embodied in the application’s API calls or in the intermediate output
    ﬁle often describes the desired results at too low a level; any higher-level informa-
    tion maintained by the original application has been lost and is not available to
    the printer driver or translator.
Figures 2.1 and 2.2 show how Adobe Acrobat products support these indirect
approaches. PDF Writer (Figure 2.1), available on the Windows and Mac OS
platforms, acts as a printer driver, intercepting graphics and text operations gen-
erated by a running application program through the operating system’s API.
Instead of converting these operations into printer commands and transmitting
them directly to a printer, PDF Writer converts them to equivalent PDF operators
and embeds them in a PDF ﬁle. The result is a platform-independent ﬁle that can
be viewed and printed by a PDF viewer application, such as Adobe Acrobat, run-
ning on any supported platform—even a different platform from the one on
which the ﬁle was originally generated.

Instead of describing their printable output via API calls, some applications pro-
duce PostScript page descriptions directly—either because of limitations in the
QuickDraw or GDI imaging models or because the applications run on platforms
such as DOS or UNIX®, where no system-level printer driver exists. PostScript
    ﬁles generated by such applications can be converted into PDF ﬁles using the
    Acrobat Distiller® application (see Figure 2.2). Because PostScript and PDF share
    the same Adobe imaging model, Acrobat Distiller can preserve the exact graph-
    ical content of the PostScript ﬁle in the translation to PDF. Additionally, Distiller
    supports a PostScript language extension, called pdfmark, that allows the produc-
    ing application to embed instructions in the PostScript ﬁle for creating hypertext
    links, logical structure, and other interactive and document interchange features
    of PDF. Again, the resulting PDF ﬁle can be viewed with a viewer application,
    such as Adobe Acrobat, on any supported platform.

2.4 PDF and the PostScript Language
    The PDF operators for setting the graphics state and painting graphics objects are
    similar to the corresponding operators in the PostScript language. Unlike Post-
    Script, however, PDF is not a full-scale programming language; it trades reduced
    ﬂexibility for improved efﬁciency and predictability. PDF therefore differs from
    PostScript in the following signiﬁcant ways:
    • PDF enforces a strictly deﬁned ﬁle structure that allows an application to access
       parts of a document in arbitrary order.
    • To simplify the processing of content streams, PDF does not include common
       programming language features such as procedures, variables, and control con-
       structs.
• PDF ﬁles contain information such as font metrics to ensure viewing ﬁdelity.
• A PDF ﬁle may contain additional information that is not directly connected
  with the imaging model, such as hypertext links for interactive viewing and
  logical structure information for document interchange.
Because of these differences, a PDF ﬁle generally cannot be transmitted directly
to a PostScript output device for printing (although a few such devices do also
support PDF directly). An application printing a PDF document to a PostScript
device must carry out the following steps:
1. Insert procedure sets containing PostScript procedure deﬁnitions to implement
   the PDF operators.
2. Extract the content for each page. Each content stream is essentially the script
   portion of a traditional PostScript program using very speciﬁc procedures,
   such as m for moveto and l for lineto.
3. Decode compressed text, graphics, and image data as necessary. The compres-
   sion ﬁlters used in PDF are compatible with those used in PostScript; they may
   or may not be supported, depending on the LanguageLevel of the target out-
   put device.
4. Insert any needed resources, such as fonts, into the PostScript ﬁle. These can
   be either the original fonts themselves or suitable substitute fonts based on the
   font metrics in the PDF ﬁle. Fonts may need to be converted to a format that
   the PostScript interpreter recognizes, such as Type 1 or Type 42.
5. Put the information in the correct order. The result is a traditional PostScript
   program that fully represents the visual aspects of the document but no longer
   contains PDF elements such as hypertext links, annotations, and bookmarks.
6. Transmit the PostScript program to the output device.

                                  3Syntax
THIS CHAPTER COVERS everything about the syntax of PDF at the object, ﬁle,
and document level. It sets the stage for subsequent chapters, which describe how
the contents of a PDF ﬁle are interpreted as page descriptions, interactive naviga-
tional aids, and application-level logical structure.
PDF syntax is best understood by thinking of it in four parts, as shown in
Figure 3.1:
• Objects. A PDF document is a data structure composed from a small set of
   basic types of data object. Section 3.1, “Lexical Conventions,” describes the
   character set used to write objects and other syntactic elements. Section 3.2,
   “Objects,” describes the syntax and essential properties of the objects them-
   selves. Section 3.2.7, “Stream Objects,” provides complete details of the most
   complex data type, the stream object.
• File structure. The PDF ﬁle structure determines how objects are stored in a
   PDF ﬁle, how they are accessed, and how they are updated. This structure is
   independent of the semantics of the objects. Section 3.4, “File Structure,” de-
   scribes the ﬁle structure. Section 3.5, “Encryption,” describes a ﬁle-level mech-
   anism for protecting a document’s contents from unauthorized access.
• Document structure. The PDF document structure speciﬁes how the basic ob-
   ject types are used to represent components of a PDF document: pages, fonts,
   annotations, and so forth. Section 3.6, “Document Structure,” describes the
   overall document structure; later chapters address the detailed semantics of the
   components.
• Content streams. A PDF content stream contains a sequence of instructions de-
   scribing the appearance of a page or other graphical entity. These instructions,
   while also represented as objects, are conceptually distinct from the objects that
                                           23
      represent the document structure and are described separately. Section 3.7,
      “Content Streams and Resources,” discusses PDF content streams and their as-
      sociated resources.

                                 FIGURE 3.1 PDF components
    In addition, this chapter describes some data structures, built from basic objects,
    that are so widely used that they can almost be considered basic object types in
    their own right. These objects are covered in Sections 3.8, “Common Data Struc-
    tures”; 3.9, “Functions”; and 3.10, “File Speciﬁcations.”
    PDF’s object and ﬁle syntax is also used as the basis for other ﬁle formats. These
    include the Forms Data Format (FDF), described in Section 8.6.6, “Forms Data
    Format,” and the Portable Job Ticket Format (PJTF), described in Adobe Techni-
    cal Note #5620, Portable Job Ticket Format.
3.1 Lexical Conventions
    At the most fundamental level, a PDF ﬁle is a sequence of 8-bit bytes. These bytes
    can be grouped into tokens according to the syntax rules described below. One or
    more tokens are then assembled to form higher-level syntactic entities, prin-
    cipally objects, which are the basic data values from which a PDF document is
    constructed.
    PDF can be entirely represented using byte values corresponding to the visible
    printable subset of the ASCII character set, plus characters that appear as “white
    space,” such as space, tab, carriage return, and line feed characters. ASCII is the
    American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a widely used convention
      for encoding a speciﬁc set of 128 characters as binary numbers. However, a PDF
      ﬁle is not restricted to the ASCII character set; it can contain arbitrary 8-bit bytes,
      subject to the following considerations:
      • The tokens that delimit objects and that describe the structure of a PDF ﬁle are
        all written in the ASCII character set, as are all the reserved words and the
        names used as keys in standard dictionaries.
      • The data values of certain types of object—strings and streams—can be but
        need not be written entirely in ASCII. For the purpose of exposition (as in this
        book), ASCII representation is preferred. However, in actual practice, data that
        is naturally binary, such as sampled images, is represented directly in binary for
        the sake of compactness and efﬁciency.
      • A PDF ﬁle containing binary data must be transported and stored by means
        that preserve all bytes of the ﬁle faithfully; that is, as a binary ﬁle rather than a
        text ﬁle. Such a ﬁle is not portable to environments that impose reserved char-
        acter codes, maximum line lengths, end-of-line conventions, or other restric-
        tions.
      Note: In this chapter, the term character is synonymous with byte and merely refers
      to a particular 8-bit value. This is entirely independent of any logical meaning that
      the value may have when it is treated as data in speciﬁc contexts, such as represent-
      ing human-readable text or selecting a glyph from a font.
3.1.1 Character Set
      The PDF character set is divided into three classes, called regular, delimiter, and
      white-space characters. This classiﬁcation determines the grouping of characters
      into tokens, except within strings, streams, and comments; different rules apply
      in those contexts.
      White-space characters (see Table 3.1) separate syntactic constructs such as names
      and numbers from each other. All white-space characters are equivalent, except
      in comments, strings, and streams. In all other contexts, PDF treats any sequence
      of consecutive white-space characters as if there were just one.

The carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters, also called newline char-
acters, are treated as end-of-line (EOL) markers. The combination of a carriage
return followed immediately by a line feed is treated as one EOL marker. For the
most part, EOL markers are treated the same as any other white-space characters.
However, there are certain instances in which an EOL marker is required or rec-
ommended—that is, the following token must appear at the beginning of a line.
Note: The examples in this book illustrate a recommended convention for arranging
tokens into lines. However, the examples’ use of white space for indentation is purely
for clarity of exposition and is not recommended for practical use.
The delimiter characters (, ), <, >, [, ], {, }, /, and % are special. They delimit syntac-
tic entities such as strings, arrays, names, and comments. Any of these characters
terminates the entity preceding it and is not included in the entity.
All characters besides the white-space characters and delimiters are referred to as
regular characters. These include 8-bit binary characters that are outside the
ASCII character set. A sequence of consecutive regular characters comprises a
single token.
Note: PDF is case-sensitive; corresponding uppercase and lowercase letters are con-
sidered distinct.
3.1.2 Comments
      Any occurrence of the percent sign character (%) outside a string or stream intro-
      duces a comment. The comment consists of all characters between the percent
      sign and the end of the line, including regular, delimiter, space, and tab charac-
      ters. PDF ignores comments, treating them as if they were single white-space
      characters. That is, a comment separates the token preceding it from the one fol-
      lowing; thus the PDF fragment
          abc% comment {/%) blah blah blah
          123
      is syntactically equivalent to just the tokens abc and 123.
      Comments (other than the %PDF−1.4 and %%EOF comments described in Sec-
      tion 3.4, “File Structure”) have no semantics. They are not necessarily preserved
      by applications that edit PDF ﬁles (see implementation note 2 in Appendix H). In
      particular, there is no PDF equivalent of the PostScript document structuring
      conventions (DSC).
 3.2 Objects
      PDF supports eight basic types of object:
      •  Boolean values
      •  Integer and real numbers
      •  Strings
      •  Names
      •  Arrays
      •  Dictionaries
      •  Streams
      •  The null object
      Objects may be labeled so that they can be referred to by other objects. A labeled
      object is called an indirect object.
      The following sections describe each object type, as well as how to create and
      refer to indirect objects.
3.2.1 Boolean Objects
      PDF provides boolean objects identiﬁed by the keywords true and false. Boolean
      objects can be used as the values of array elements and dictionary entries, and
      can also occur in PostScript calculator functions as the results of boolean and
      relational operators and as operands to the conditional operators if and ifelse
      (see Section 3.9.4, “Type 4 (PostScript Calculator) Functions”).
3.2.2 Numeric Objects
      PDF provides two types of numeric object: integer and real. Integer objects rep-
      resent mathematical integers within a certain interval centered at 0. Real objects
      approximate mathematical real numbers, but with limited range and precision;
      they are typically represented in ﬁxed-point, rather than ﬂoating-point, form.
      The range and precision of numbers are limited by the internal representations
      used in the machine on which the PDF viewer application is running; Appendix
      C gives these limits for typical implementations.
      An integer is written one or more decimal digits optionally preceded by a sign:
         123    43445   +17   −98  0
      The value is interpreted as a signed decimal integer and is converted to an integer
      object. If it exceeds the implementation limit for integers, it is converted to a real
      object.
      A real value is written as one or more decimal digits with an optional sign and a
      leading, trailing, or embedded period (decimal point):
         34.5   −3.62   +123.6  4.  −.002 0.0
      The value is interpreted as a real number and is converted to a real object. If it
      exceeds the implementation limit for real numbers, an error occurs.
      Note: PDF does not support the PostScript syntax for numbers with nondecimal
      radices (such as 16#FFFE) or in exponential format (such as 6.02E23).
      Throughout this book, the term number refers to an object whose type may be
      either integer or real. Wherever a real number is expected, an integer may be used
      instead and will be automatically converted to an equivalent real value. For ex-
      ample, it is not necessary to write the number 1.0 in real format; the integer 1 will
      sufﬁce.
3.2.3 String Objects
      A string object consists of a series of bytes—unsigned integer values in the range 0
      to 255. The string elements are not integer objects, but are stored in a more
      compact format. The length of a string is subject to an implementation limit; see
      Appendix C.
      There are two conventions, described in the following sections, for writing a
      string object in PDF:
      • As a sequence of literal characters enclosed in parentheses ( )
      • As hexadecimal data enclosed in angle brackets < >
      This section describes only the basic syntax for writing a string as a sequence of
      bytes. Strings can be used for many purposes and can be formatted in a variety of
      ways. When a string is used for a speciﬁc purpose (to represent a date, for ex-
      ample), it is useful to have a standard format for that purpose (see Section 3.8.2,
      “Dates”). Such formats are merely conventions for interpreting the contents of a
      string and are not in themselves separate object types. The use of a particular for-
      mat is described with the deﬁnition of the string object that uses that format.
      Literal Strings
      A literal string is written as an arbitrary number of characters enclosed in paren-
      theses. Any characters may appear in a string except unbalanced parentheses and
      the backslash, which must be treated specially. Balanced pairs of parentheses
      within a string require no special treatment.
      The following are valid literal strings:
         (This is a string)
         (Strings may contain newlines
         and such.)
   (Strings may contain balanced parentheses ( ) and
   special characters (*!&}^% and so on).)
   (The following is an empty string.)
   ()
   (It has zero (0) length.)
Within a literal string, the backslash (\) is used as an escape character for various
purposes, such as to include newline characters, nonprinting ASCII characters,
unbalanced parentheses, or the backslash character itself in the string. The char-
acter immediately following the backslash determines its precise interpretation
(see Table 3.2). If the character following the backslash is not one of those shown
in the table, the backslash is ignored.
                        TABLE 3.2 Escape sequences in literal strings
SEQUENCE                 MEANING
   \n                    Line feed (LF)
   \r                    Carriage return (CR)
   \t                    Horizontal tab (HT)
   \b                    Backspace (BS)
   \f                    Form feed (FF)
   \(                    Left parenthesis
   \)                    Right parenthesis
   \\                    Backslash
   \ddd                  Character code ddd (octal)
If a string is too long to be conveniently placed on a single line, it may be split
across multiple lines by using the backslash character at the end of a line to indi-
cate that the string continues on the following line. The backslash and the end-
of-line marker following it are not considered part of the string. For example:
   (These \
   two strings \
   are the same.)
   (These two strings are the same.)
If an end-of-line marker appears within a literal string without a preceding back-
slash, the result is equivalent to \n (regardless of whether the end-of-line marker
itself was a carriage return, a line feed, or both). For example:
    (This string has an end−of−line at the end of it.
    )
    (So does this one.\n)
The \ddd escape sequence provides a way to represent characters outside the
printable ASCII character set. For example:
    (This string contains \245two octal characters\307.)
The number ddd may consist of one, two, or three octal digits, with high-order
overﬂow ignored. It is required that three octal digits be used, with leading zeros
as needed, if the next character of the string is also a digit. For example, the literal
    (\0053)
denotes a string containing two characters, \005 (Control-E) followed by the digit
3, whereas both
    (\053)
and
    (\53)
denote strings containing the single character \053, a plus sign (+).
This notation provides a way to specify characters outside the 7-bit ASCII charac-
ter set using ASCII characters only. However, any 8-bit value may appear in a
string. In particular, when a document is encrypted (see Section 3.5, “Encryp-
tion”), all of its strings are encrypted and often contain arbitrary 8-bit values.
Note that the backslash character is still required as an escape to specify unbal-
anced parentheses or the backslash character itself.
      Hexadecimal Strings
      Strings may also be written in hexadecimal form; this is useful for including arbi-
      trary binary data in a PDF ﬁle. A hexadecimal string is written as a sequence of
      hexadecimal digits (0–9 and either A–F or a–f ) enclosed within angle brackets
      (< and >):
          <4E6F762073686D6F7A206B6120706F702E>
      Each pair of hexadecimal digits deﬁnes one byte of the string. White-space char-
      acters (such as space, tab, carriage return, line feed, and form feed) are ignored.
      If the ﬁnal digit of a hexadecimal string is missing—that is, if there is an odd
      number of digits—the ﬁnal digit is assumed to be 0. For example,
          <901FA3>
      is a 3-byte string consisting of the characters whose hexadecimal codes are 90, 1F,
      and A3, but
          <901FA>
      is a 3-byte string containing the characters whose hexadecimal codes are 90, 1F,
      and A0.
3.2.4 Name Objects
      A name object is an atomic symbol uniquely deﬁned by a sequence of characters.
      Uniquely deﬁned means that any two name objects made up of the same sequence
      of characters are identically the same object. Atomic means that a name has no
      internal structure; although it is deﬁned by a sequence of characters, those char-
      acters are not “elements” of the name.
      A slash character (/) introduces a name. The slash is not part of the name itself,
      but a preﬁx indicating that the following sequence of characters constitutes a
      name. There can be no white-space characters between the slash and the ﬁrst
      character in the name. The name may include any regular characters, but not
      delimiter or white-space characters (see Section 3.1, “Lexical Conventions”).
Uppercase and lowercase letters are considered distinct: /A and /a are different
names. The following are examples of valid literal names:
   /Name1
   /ASomewhatLongerName
   /A;Name_With−Various***Characters?
   /1.2
   /$$
   /@pattern
   /.notdef
Note: The token / (a slash followed by no regular characters) is a valid name.
Beginning with PDF 1.2, any character except null (character code 0) may be in-
cluded in a name by writing its 2-digit hexadecimal code, preceded by the num-
ber sign character (#); see implementation notes 3 and 4 in Appendix H. This
syntax is required in order to represent any of the delimiter or white-space char-
acters or the number sign character itself; it is recommended but not required for
characters whose codes are outside the range 33 (!) to 126 (~). The examples
shown in Table 3.3 are valid literal names in PDF 1.2 and higher.
              TABLE 3.3 Examples of literal names using the # character
LITERAL NAME                                RESUL T
/Adobe#20Green                              Adobe Green
/PANTONE#205757#20CV                        PANTONE 5757 CV
/paired#28#29parentheses                    paired()parentheses
/The_Key_of_F#23_Minor                      The_Key_of_F#_Minor
/A#42                                       AB
The length of a name is subject to an implementation limit; see Appendix C. The
limit applies to the number of characters in the name’s internal representation.
For example, the name /A#20B has four characters (/, A, space, B), not six.
As stated above, name objects are treated as atomic symbols within a PDF ﬁle.
Ordinarily, the bytes making up the name are never treated as text to be presented
to a human user or to an application external to a PDF viewer. However, occa-
      sionally the need arises to treat a name object as text, such as one that represents a
      font name (see the BaseFont entry in Table 5.8 on page 317) or a structure type
      (see Section 9.6.2, “Structure Types”).
      In such situations, it is recommended that the sequence of bytes (after expansion
      of # sequences, if any) be interpreted according to UTF-8, a variable-length byte-
      encoded representation of Unicode in which the printable ASCII characters have
      the same representations as in ASCII. This enables a name object to represent text
      in any natural language, subject to the implementation limit on the length of a
      name. (See implementation note 5 in Appendix H.)
      Note: PDF does not prescribe what UTF-8 sequence to choose for representing any
      given piece of externally speciﬁed text as a name object. In some cases, there are mul-
      tiple UTF-8 sequences that could represent the same logical text. Name objects de-
      ﬁned by different sequences of bytes constitute distinct name objects in PDF, even
      though the UTF-8 sequences might have identical external interpretations.
      In PDF, name objects always begin with the slash character (/), unlike keywords
      such as true, false, and obj. This book follows a typographic convention of writ-
      ing names without the leading slash when they appear in running text and tables.
      For example, Type and FullScreen denote names that would actually be written in
      a PDF ﬁle (and in code examples in this book) as /Type and /FullScreen.
3.2.5 Array Objects
      An array object is a one-dimensional collection of objects arranged sequentially.
      Unlike arrays in many other computer languages, PDF arrays may be hetero-
      geneous; that is, an array’s elements may be any combination of numbers, strings,
      dictionaries, or any other objects, including other arrays. The number of ele-
      ments in an array is subject to an implementation limit; see Appendix C.
      An array is written as a sequence of objects enclosed in square brackets ([ and ]):
         [549 3.14 false (Ralph) /SomeName]
      PDF directly supports only one-dimensional arrays. Arrays of higher dimension
      can be constructed by using arrays as elements of arrays, nested to any depth.
3.2.6 Dictionary Objects
      A dictionary object is an associative table containing pairs of objects, known as the
      dictionary’s entries. The ﬁrst element of each entry is the key and the second
      element is the value. The key must be a name (unlike dictionary keys in Post-
      Script, which may be objects of any type). The value can be any kind of object,
      including another dictionary. A dictionary entry whose value is null (see Section
      3.2.8, “The Null Object”) is equivalent to an absent entry. (Note that this differs
      from PostScript, where null behaves like any other object as the value of a diction-
      ary entry.) The number of entries in a dictionary is subject to an implementation
      limit; see Appendix C.
      Note: No two entries in the same dictionary should have the same key. If a key does
      appear more than once, its value is undeﬁned.
      A dictionary is written as a sequence of key-value pairs enclosed in double angle
      brackets (<< … >>). For example:
         << /Type /Example
             /Subtype /DictionaryExample
             /Version 0.01
             /IntegerItem 12
             /StringItem (a string)
             /Subdictionary << /Item1 0.4
                                 /Item2 true
                                 /LastItem (not!)
                                 /VeryLastItem (OK)
                             >>
         >>
      Note: Do not confuse the double angle brackets with single angle brackets (< and >),
      which delimit a hexadecimal string (see “Hexadecimal Strings” on page 32).
      Dictionary objects are the main building blocks of a PDF document. They are
      commonly used to collect and tie together the attributes of a complex object,
      such as a font or a page of the document, with each entry in the dictionary speci-
      fying the name and value of an attribute. By convention, the Type entry of such a
      dictionary identiﬁes the type of object the dictionary describes. In some cases, a
      Subtype entry (sometimes abbreviated S) is used to further identify a specialized
      subcategory of the general type. The value of the Type or Subtype entry is always
      a name. For example, in a font dictionary, the value of the Type entry is always
      Font, whereas that of the Subtype entry may be Type1, TrueType, or one of sever-
      al other values.
      The value of the Type entry can almost always be inferred from context. The op-
      erand of the Tf operator, for example, must be a font object, so the Type entry in a
      font dictionary serves primarily as documentation and as information for error
      checking. The Type entry is not required unless so stated in its description; how-
      ever, if the entry is present, it must have the correct value. In addition, the value
      of the Type entry in any dictionary, even in private data, must be either a name
      deﬁned in this book or a registered name; see Appendix E for details.
3.2.7 Stream Objects
      A stream object, like a string object, is a sequence of bytes. However, a PDF appli-
      cation can read a stream incrementally, while a string must be read in its entirety.
      Furthermore, a stream can be of unlimited length, whereas a string is subject to
      an implementation limit. For this reason, objects with potentially large amounts
      of data, such as images and page descriptions, are represented as streams.
      Note: As with strings, this section describes only the syntax for writing a stream as a
      sequence of bytes. What those bytes represent is determined by the context in which
      the stream is referenced.
      A stream consists of a dictionary that describes a sequence of bytes, followed by
      zero or more lines of bytes bracketed between the keywords stream and
      endstream:
         dictionary
         stream
         …Zero or more lines of bytes…
         endstream
      All streams must be indirect objects (see Section 3.2.9, “Indirect Objects”) and
      the stream dictionary must be a direct object. The keyword stream that follows
      the stream dictionary should be followed by either a carriage return and a line
      feed or by just a line feed, and not by a carriage return alone. The sequence of
      bytes that make up a stream lie between the stream and endstream keywords; the
stream dictionary speciﬁes the exact number of bytes. Alternatively, in PDF 1.2
the bytes may be contained in an external ﬁle, in which case the stream dictionary
speciﬁes the ﬁle and any bytes between stream and endstream are ignored. (See
implementation note 6 in Appendix H.)
Note: Without the restriction against following the keyword stream by a carriage re-
turn alone, it would be impossible to differentiate a stream that uses carriage return
as its end-of-line marker and has a line feed as its ﬁrst byte of data from one that uses
a carriage return–line feed sequence to denote end-of-line.
Table 3.4 lists the entries common to all stream dictionaries; certain types of
stream may have additional dictionary entries, as indicated where those streams
are described. The optional entries regarding ﬁlters for the stream indicate
whether and how the data in the stream must be transformed (“decoded”) before
it is used. Filters are described further in Section 3.3, “Filters.”
Stream Extent
Every stream dictionary has a Length entry that indicates how many bytes of the
PDF ﬁle are used for the stream’s data. (If the stream has a ﬁlter, Length is the
number of bytes of encoded data.) In addition, most ﬁlters are deﬁned so that the
data is self-limiting; that is, they use an encoding scheme in which an explicit
end-of-data (EOD) marker delimits the extent of the data. Finally, streams are
used to represent many objects from whose attributes a length can be inferred. All
of these constraints must be consistent.
For example, an image with 10 rows and 20 columns, using a single color compo-
nent and 8 bits per component, requires exactly 200 bytes of image data. If the
stream uses a ﬁlter, there must be enough bytes of encoded data in the PDF ﬁle to
produce those 200 bytes. An error occurs if Length is too small, if an explicit
EOD marker occurs too soon, or if the decoded data does not contain 200 bytes.
It is also an error if the stream contains too much data, with the exception that
there may be an extra end-of-line marker in the PDF ﬁle before the keyword
endstream.

3.2.8 Null Object
      The null object has a type and value that are unequal to those of any other object.
      There is only one object of type null, denoted by the keyword null. An indirect
      object reference (see Section 3.2.9, “Indirect Objects”) to a nonexistent object is
      treated the same as a null object; specifying the null object as the value of a dic-
      tionary entry (Section 3.2.6, “Dictionary Objects”) is equivalent to omitting the
      entry entirely.
3.2.9 Indirect Objects
      Any object in a PDF ﬁle may be labeled as an indirect object. This gives the object
      a unique object identiﬁer by which other objects can refer to it (for example, as an
      element of an array or as the value of a dictionary entry). The object identiﬁer
      consists of two parts:
      • A positive integer object number. Indirect objects are often numbered sequen-
         tially within a PDF ﬁle, but this is not required; object numbers may be
         assigned in any arbitrary order.
      • A nonnegative integer generation number. In a newly created ﬁle, all indirect
         objects have generation numbers of 0. Nonzero generation numbers may be in-
         troduced when the ﬁle is later updated; see Sections 3.4.3, “Cross-Reference
         Table,” and 3.4.5, “Incremental Updates.”
      Together, the combination of an object number and a generation number
      uniquely identiﬁes an indirect object. The object retains the same object number
      and generation number throughout its existence, even if its value is modiﬁed.
      The deﬁnition of an indirect object in a PDF ﬁle consists of its object number and
      generation number, followed by the value of the object itself bracketed between
      the keywords obj and endobj. For example, the deﬁnition
          12 0 obj
              (Brillig)
          endobj
      deﬁnes an indirect string object with an object number of 12, a generation num-
      ber of 0, and the value Brillig. The object can then be referred to from elsewhere in
the ﬁle by an indirect reference consisting of the object number, the generation
number, and the keyword R:
    12 0 R
An indirect reference to an undeﬁned object is not an error; it is simply treated as
a reference to the null object. For example, if a ﬁle contains the indirect reference
    17 0 R
but does not contain the corresponding deﬁnition
    17 0 obj
        …
    endobj
then the indirect reference is considered to refer to the null object.
Note: In the data structures that make up a PDF document, certain values are re-
quired to be speciﬁed as indirect object references. Except where this is explicitly
called out, any object (other than a stream) may be speciﬁed either directly or as an
indirect object reference; the semantics are entirely equivalent. Note in particular
that content streams, which deﬁne the visible contents of the document, may not con-
tain indirect references (see Section 3.7.1, “Content Streams”).
Example 3.1 shows the use of an indirect object to specify the length of a stream.
The value of the stream’s Length entry is an integer object that follows the stream
itself in the ﬁle. This allows applications that generate PDF in a single pass to
defer specifying the stream’s length until after its contents have been generated.
Example 3.1
    7 0 obj
        << /Length 8 0 R >>                       % An indirect reference to object 8

        endobj
3.3 Filters
    Stream ﬁlters are introduced in Section 3.2.7, “Stream Objects.” A ﬁlter is an
    optional part of the speciﬁcation of a stream, indicating how the data in the
    stream must be decoded before it is used. For example, if a stream has an
    ASCIIHexDecode ﬁlter, an application reading the data in that stream will trans-
    form the ASCII hexadecimal-encoded data in the stream into binary data.
    An application program that produces a PDF ﬁle can encode certain information
    (for example, data for sampled images) to compress it or to convert it to a port-
    able ASCII representation. Then an application that reads (“consumes”) the PDF
    ﬁle can invoke the corresponding decoding ﬁlter to convert the information back
    to its original form.
    The ﬁlter or ﬁlters for a stream are speciﬁed by the Filter entry in the stream’s dic-
    tionary (or the FFilter entry if the stream is external). Filters can be cascaded to
    form a pipeline that passes the stream through two or more decoding transforma-
    tions in sequence. For example, data encoded using LZW and ASCII base-85
    encoding (in that order) can be decoded using the following entry in the stream
    dictionary:
        /Filter [/ASCII85Decode /LZWDecode]
    Some ﬁlters may take parameters to control how they operate. These optional
    parameters are speciﬁed by the DecodeParms entry in the stream’s dictionary (or
    the FDecodeParms entry if the stream is external).
    PDF supports a standard set of ﬁlters that fall into two main categories:
    • ASCII ﬁlters enable decoding of arbitrary 8-bit binary data that has been en-
       coded as ASCII text. (See Section 3.1, “Lexical Conventions,” for an explanation
       of why this type of encoding might be useful.) Note that ASCII ﬁlters serve no
       useful purpose in a PDF ﬁle that is encrypted; see Section 3.5, “Encryption.”
    • Decompression ﬁlters enable decoding of data that has been compressed. The
       compressed data is always in 8-bit binary format, even if the original data hap-
       pens to be ASCII text. (Compression is particularly valuable for large sampled
            images, since it reduces storage requirements and transmission time. Note that
            some types of compression are lossy, meaning that some data is lost during the
            encoding, resulting in a loss of quality when the data is decompressed; com-
            pression in which no loss of data occurs is called lossless.)
          The standard ﬁlters are summarized in Table 3.5, which also indicates whether
          they accept any optional parameters. The following sections describe these ﬁlters
          and their parameters (if any) in greater detail, including speciﬁcations of encod-
          ing algorithms for some ﬁlters. (See also implementation notes 8 and 9 in Appen-
          dix H.)

3.3.1 ASCIIHexDecode Filter
      The ASCIIHexDecode ﬁlter decodes data that has been encoded in ASCII hexa-
      decimal form. ASCII hexadecimal encoding and ASCII base-85 encoding
      (described in the next section) convert binary data, such as image data, to 7-bit
      ASCII characters. In general, ASCII base-85 encoding is preferred to ASCII hexa-
      decimal encoding because it is more compact: it expands the data by a factor of
      4:5, compared with 1:2 for ASCII hexadecimal encoding.
      For each pair of ASCII hexadecimal digits (0–9 and A–F or a–f ), the ASCIIHex-
      Decode ﬁlter produces one byte of binary data. All white-space characters (see
      Section 3.1, “Lexical Conventions”) are ignored. A right angle bracket character
      (>) indicates EOD. Any other characters will cause an error. If the ﬁlter encoun-
      ters the EOD marker after reading an odd number of hexadecimal digits, it will
      behave as if a 0 followed the last digit.
3.3.2 ASCII85Decode Filter
      The ASCII85Decode ﬁlter decodes data that has been encoded in ASCII base-85
      encoding and produces binary data. The following paragraphs describe the pro-
      cess for encoding binary data in ASCII base-85; the ASCII85Decode ﬁlter reverses
      this process.
      The ASCII base-85 encoding uses the characters ! through u and the character z,
      with the 2-character sequence ~> as its EOD marker. The ASCII85Decode ﬁlter
      ignores all white-space characters (see Section 3.1, “Lexical Conventions”). Any
      other characters, and any character sequences that represent impossible combi-
      nations in the ASCII base-85 encoding, will cause an error.
      Speciﬁcally, ASCII base-85 encoding produces 5 ASCII characters for every 4
      bytes of binary data. Each group of 4 binary input bytes, (b1 b2 b3 b4 ), is convert-
      ed to a group of 5 output bytes, (c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 ), using the relation
                        3               2               1
          ( b 1 × 256 ) + ( b 2 × 256 ) + ( b 3 × 256 ) + b 4 =
                          4               3             2              1
                ( c 1 × 85 ) + ( c 2 × 85 ) + ( c 3 × 85 ) + ( c 4 × 85 ) + c 5
      In other words, 4 bytes of binary data are interpreted as a base-256 number and
      then converted into a base-85 number. The ﬁve “digits” of the base-85 number
      are then converted to ASCII characters by adding 33 (the ASCII code for the
      character ! ) to each. The resulting encoded data contains only printable ASCII
      characters with codes in the range 33 ( ! ) to 117 (u). As a special case, if all ﬁve
      digits are 0, they are represented by the character with code 122 (z) instead of by
      ﬁve exclamation points ( !!!!! ).
      If the length of the binary data to be encoded is not a multiple of 4 bytes, the last,
      partial group of 4 is used to produce a last, partial group of 5 output characters.
      Given n (1, 2, or 3) bytes of binary data, the encoder ﬁrst appends 4 − n zero bytes
      to make a complete group of 4. It then encodes this group in the usual way, but
      without applying the special z case. Finally, it writes only the ﬁrst n + 1 characters
      of the resulting group of 5. These characters are immediately followed by the ~>
      EOD marker.
      The following conditions (which never occur in a correctly encoded byte se-
      quence) will cause errors during decoding:
      • The value represented by a group of 5 characters is greater than 232 − 1.
      • A z character occurs in the middle of a group.
      • A ﬁnal partial group contains only one character.
3.3.3 LZWDecode and FlateDecode Filters
      The LZWDecode and (in PDF 1.2) FlateDecode ﬁlters have much in common
      and so are discussed together in this section. They decode data that has been en-
      coded using the LZW or Flate data compression method, respectively.
• LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) is a variable-length, adaptive compression method
  that has been adopted as one of the standard compression methods in the Tag
  Image File Format (TIFF) standard. Details on LZW encoding follow in the
  next section.
• The Flate method is based on the public-domain zlib/deﬂate compression
  method, which is a variable-length Lempel-Ziv adaptive compression method
  cascaded with adaptive Huffman coding. It is fully deﬁned in Internet RFCs
  1950, ZLIB Compressed Data Format Speciﬁcation, and 1951, DEFLATE Com-
  pressed Data Format Speciﬁcation (see the Bibliography).
Both of these methods compress either binary data or ASCII text but (like all
compression methods) always produce binary data, even if the original data was
text.
The LZW and Flate compression methods can discover and exploit many pat-
terns in the input data, whether the data is text or images. As described later, both
ﬁlters support optional transformation by a predictor function, which improves
the compression of sampled image data. Thanks to its cascaded adaptive Huff-
man coding, Flate-encoded output is usually much more compact than LZW-
encoded output for the same input. Flate and LZW decoding speeds are com-
parable, but Flate encoding is considerably slower than LZW encoding.
Usually, both Flate and LZW encodings compress their input substantially. How-
ever, in the worst case (in which no pair of adjacent characters appears twice),
Flate encoding expands its input by no more than 11 bytes or a factor of 1.003
(whichever is larger), plus the effects of algorithm tags added by PNG predictors.
For LZW encoding, the best case (all zeros) provides a compression approaching
1365:1 for long ﬁles, but the worst-case expansion is at least a factor of 1.125,
which can increase to nearly 1.5 in some implementations (plus the effects of
PNG tags as with Flate encoding).
Details of LZW Encoding
Data encoded using the LZW compression method consists of a sequence of
codes that are 9 to 12 bits long. Each code represents a single character of input
data (0–255), a clear-table marker (256), an EOD marker (257), or a table entry
representing a multiple-character sequence that has been encountered previously
in the input (258 or greater).
Initially, the code length is 9 bits and the LZW table contains only entries for the
258 ﬁxed codes. As encoding proceeds, entries are appended to the table, asso-
ciating new codes with longer and longer sequences of input characters. The
encoder and the decoder maintain identical copies of this table.
Whenever both the encoder and the decoder independently (but synchronously)
realize that the current code length is no longer sufﬁcient to represent the num-
ber of entries in the table, they increase the number of bits per code by 1. The ﬁrst
output code that is 10 bits long is the one following the creation of table entry
511, and similarly for 11 (1023) and 12 (2047) bits. Codes are never longer than
12 bits, so entry 4095 is the last entry of the LZW table.
The encoder executes the following sequence of steps to generate each output
code:
1. Accumulate a sequence of one or more input characters matching a sequence
   already present in the table. For maximum compression, the encoder looks for
   the longest such sequence.
2. Emit the code corresponding to that sequence.
3. Create a new table entry for the ﬁrst unused code. Its value is the sequence
   found in step 1 followed by the next input character.
For example, suppose the input consists of the following sequence of ASCII char-
acter codes:
   45 45 45 45 45 65 45 45 45 66
Starting with an empty table, the encoder proceeds as shown in Table 3.6.
Codes are packed into a continuous bit stream, high-order bit ﬁrst. This stream is
then divided into 8-bit bytes, high-order bit ﬁrst. Thus, codes can straddle byte
boundaries arbitrarily. After the EOD marker (code value 257), any leftover bits
in the ﬁnal byte are set to 0.

–                   257 (EOD)              –                –
In the example above, all the output codes are 9 bits long; they would pack into
bytes as follows (represented in hexadecimal):
   80 0B 60 50 22 0C 0C 85 01
To adapt to changing input sequences, the encoder may at any point issue a clear-
table code, which causes both the encoder and the decoder to restart with initial
tables and a 9-bit code length. By convention, the encoder begins by issuing a
clear-table code. It must issue a clear-table code when the table becomes full; it
may do so sooner.

LZWDecode and FlateDecode Parameters
The LZWDecode and FlateDecode ﬁlters accept optional parameters to control
the decoding process. Most of these parameters are related to techniques that re-
          duce the size of compressed sampled images (rectangular arrays of color values,
          described in Section 4.8, “Images”). For example, image data frequently changes
          very little from sample to sample; subtracting the values of adjacent samples (a
          process called differencing), and encoding the differences rather than the raw
          sample values, can reduce the size of the output data. Furthermore, when the
          image data contains several color components (red-green-blue or cyan-magenta-
          yellow-black) per sample, taking the difference between the values of corre-
          sponding components in adjacent samples, rather than between different color
          components in the same sample, often reduces the output data size.
          Table 3.7 shows the parameters that can optionally be speciﬁed for LZWDecode
          and FlateDecode ﬁlters. Except where otherwise noted, all values supplied to the
          decoding ﬁlter for any optional parameters must match those used when the data
          was encoded.

LZW and Flate Predictor Functions
LZW and Flate encoding compress more compactly if their input data is highly
predictable. One way of increasing the predictability of many continuous-tone
sampled images is to replace each sample with the difference between that sample
and a predictor function applied to earlier neighboring samples. If the predictor
function works well, the postprediction data will cluster toward 0.
Two groups of predictor functions are supported. The ﬁrst, the TIFF group, con-
sists of the single function that is Predictor 2 in the TIFF standard. (In the TIFF
standard, Predictor 2 applies only to LZW compression, but here it applies to
Flate compression as well.) TIFF Predictor 2 predicts that each color component
of a sample will be the same as the corresponding color component of the sample
immediately to its left.
The second supported group of predictor functions, the PNG group, consists of
the “ﬁlters” of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Portable Network Graphics
recommendation, documented in Internet RFC 2083, PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) Speciﬁcation (see the Bibliography). The term predictors is used here in-
stead of ﬁlters to avoid confusion. There are ﬁve basic PNG predictor algorithms
(and a sixth that chooses the optimum predictor function separately for each
row):
    None        No prediction
    Sub         Predicts the same as the sample to the left
    Up          Predicts the same as the sample above
    Average     Predicts the average of the sample to the left and the sample above
    Paeth       A nonlinear function of the sample above, the sample to the left,
                and the sample to the upper left
The predictor algorithm to be used, if any, is indicated by the Predictor ﬁlter
parameter (see Table 3.7), which can have any of the values listed in Table 3.8.
For LZWDecode and FlateDecode, a Predictor value greater than or equal to 10
merely indicates that a PNG predictor is in use; the speciﬁc predictor function
used is explicitly encoded in the incoming data. The value of Predictor supplied
by the decoding ﬁlter need not match the value used when the data was encoded
if they are both greater than or equal to 10.
                             TABLE 3.8 Predictor values
VALUE                MEANING
   1                 No prediction (the default value)
   2                 TIFF Predictor 2
  10                 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG None on all rows)
  11                 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Sub on all rows)
  12                 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Up on all rows)
  13                 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Average on all rows)
  14                 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG Paeth on all rows)
  15                 PNG prediction (on encoding, PNG optimum)
The two groups of predictor functions have some commonalities. Both assume
the following:
• Data is presented in order, from the top row to the bottom row and, within a
  row, from left to right.
• A row occupies a whole number of bytes, rounded up if necessary.
• Samples and their components are packed into bytes from high-order to low-
  order bits.
• All color components of samples outside the image (which are necessary for
  predictions near the boundaries) are 0.
The predictor function groups also differ in signiﬁcant ways:
• The postprediction data for each PNG-predicted row begins with an explicit
  algorithm tag, so different rows can be predicted with different algorithms to
  improve compression. TIFF Predictor 2 has no such identiﬁer; the same algo-
  rithm applies to all rows.
• The TIFF function group predicts each color component from the prior in-
  stance of that component, taking into account the number of bits per com-
  ponent and components per sample. In contrast, the PNG function group
  predicts each byte of data as a function of the corresponding byte of one or
         more previous image samples, regardless of whether there are multiple color
         components in a byte or whether a single color component spans multiple
         bytes. This can yield signiﬁcantly better speed at the cost of somewhat worse
         compression.
3.3.4 RunLengthDecode Filter
      The RunLengthDecode ﬁlter decodes data that has been encoded in a simple
      byte-oriented format based on run length. The encoded data is a sequence of
      runs, where each run consists of a length byte followed by 1 to 128 bytes of data. If
      the length byte is in the range 0 to 127, the following length + 1 (1 to 128) bytes
      are copied literally during decompression. If length is in the range 129 to 255, the
      following single byte is to be copied 257 − length (2 to 128) times during decom-
      pression. A length value of 128 denotes EOD.
      The compression achieved by run-length encoding depends on the input data. In
      the best case (all zeros), a compression of approximately 64:1 is achieved for long
      ﬁles. The worst case (the hexadecimal sequence 00 alternating with FF) results in
      an expansion of 127:128.
3.3.5 CCITTFaxDecode Filter
      The CCITTFaxDecode ﬁlter decodes image data that has been encoded using
      either Group 3 or Group 4 CCITT facsimile (fax) encoding. CCITT encoding is
      designed to achieve efﬁcient compression of monochrome (1 bit per pixel) image
      data at relatively low resolutions, and so is useful only for bitmap image data, not
      for color images, grayscale images, or general data.
      The CCITT encoding standard is deﬁned by the International Telecommunica-
      tions Union (ITU), formerly known as the Comité Consultatif International
      Téléphonique et Télégraphique (International Coordinating Committee for Tele-
      phony and Telegraphy). The encoding algorithm is not described in detail here,
      but can be found in ITU Recommendations T.4 and T.6 (see the Bibliography).
      For historical reasons, we refer to these documents as the CCITT standard.
    CCITT encoding is bit-oriented, not byte-oriented. This means that, in principle,
    encoded or decoded data might not end at a byte boundary. This problem is dealt
    with in the following ways:
    • Unencoded data is treated as complete scan lines, with unused bits inserted at
       the end of each scan line to ﬁll out the last byte. This is compatible with the
       PDF convention for sampled image data.
    • Encoded data is ordinarily treated as a continuous, unbroken bit stream. The
       EncodedByteAlign parameter (described in Table 3.9) can be used to cause
       each encoded scan line to be ﬁlled to a byte boundary; although this is not pre-
       scribed by the CCITT standard and fax machines never do this, some software
       packages ﬁnd it convenient to encode data this way.
    • When a ﬁlter reaches EOD, it always skips to the next byte boundary following
       the encoded data.
    If the CCITTFaxDecode ﬁlter encounters improperly encoded source data, an
    error will occur. The ﬁlter will not perform any error correction or resynchroni-
    zation, except as noted for the DamagedRowsBeforeError parameter in Table 3.9.
    Table 3.9 lists the optional parameters that can be used to control the decoding.
    Except where noted otherwise, all values supplied to the decoding ﬁlter by any of
    these parameters must match those used when the data was encoded.

          The compression achieved using CCITT encoding depends on the data, as well as
          on the value of various optional parameters. For Group 3 one-dimensional en-
          coding, in the best case (all zeros), each scan line compresses to 4 bytes, and the
      compression factor depends on the length of a scan line. If the scan line is 300
      bytes long, a compression ratio of approximately 75:1 is achieved. The worst
      case, an image of alternating ones and zeros, produces an expansion of 2:9.
3.3.6 JBIG2Decode Filter
      The JBIG2Decode ﬁlter (PDF 1.4) decodes monochrome (1 bit per pixel) image
      data that has been encoded using JBIG2 encoding. JBIG stands for the Joint Bi-
      Level Image Experts Group, a group within the International Organization for
      Standardization (ISO) that developed the format; JBIG2 is the second version of
      a standard originally released as JBIG1 and was approaching standards approval
      at the time of publication of this book.
      JBIG2 encoding, which provides for both lossy and lossless compression, is useful
      only for monochrome images, not for color images, grayscale images, or general
      data. The algorithms used by the encoder, and the details of the format, are not
      described here; a working draft of the JBIG2 speciﬁcation can be found through
      the Web site for the JBIG and JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) commit-
      tees at <http://www.jpeg.org>.
      In general, JBIG2 provides considerably better compression than the existing
      CCITT standard (discussed in Section 3.3.5). The compression it achieves de-
      pends strongly on the nature of the image. Images of pages containing text in any
      language will compress particularly well, with typical compression ratios of 20:1
      to 50:1 for a page full of text. The JBIG2 encoder builds a table of unique symbol
      bitmaps found in the image, and other symbols found later in the image are
      matched against the table. Matching symbols are replaced by an index into the ta-
      ble, and symbols that fail to match are added to the table. The table itself is com-
      pressed using other means. This results in high compression ratios for
      documents in which the same symbol is repeated often, as is typical for images
      created by scanning text pages. This method also results in high compression of
      “white space” in the image, which does not need to be encoded because it con-
      tains no symbols.
      While best compression is achieved for images of text, the JBIG2 standard also in-
      cludes algorithms for compressing regions of an image that contain dithered half-
      tone images (for example, photographs).
The JBIG2 compression method can also be used for encoding multiple images
into a single JBIG2 bit stream. Typically, these images will be scanned pages of a
multiple-page document. Since a single table of symbol bitmaps is used to match
symbols across multiple pages, this type of encoding can result in higher com-
pression ratios than if each of the pages had been individually encoded using
JBIG2.
In general, an image may be speciﬁed in PDF as either an image XObject or an in-
line image (as described in Section 4.8, “Images”); however, the JBIG2Decode ﬁl-
ter can be applied only to image XObjects.
This ﬁlter addresses both single-page and multiple-page JBIG2 bit streams, by
representing each JBIG2 “page” as a PDF image, as follows:
• The ﬁlter uses the embedded ﬁle organization of JBIG2. (The details of this and
   the other types of ﬁle organization are provided in an annex of the ISO speciﬁ-
   cation.) The optional 2-byte combination (marker) mentioned in the speciﬁca-
   tion is not used in PDF. JBIG2 bit streams in random-access organization
   should be converted to the embedded ﬁle organization. Bit streams in sequen-
   tial organization need no reorganization, except for the mappings described
   below.
• The JBIG2 ﬁle header, end-of-page segments, and end-of-ﬁle segment are not
   used in PDF. These should be removed before the PDF objects described below
   are created.
• The image XObject to which the JBIG2Decode ﬁlter is applied contains all seg-
   ments that are associated with the JBIG2 page represented by that image—that
   is, all segments whose segment page association ﬁeld contains the page number
   of the JBIG2 page represented by the image. In the image XObject, however, the
   segment’s page number should always be 1—that is, when each such segment is
   written to the XObject, the value of its segment page association ﬁeld should be
   set to 1.
• If the bit stream contains global segments (segments whose segment page asso-
   ciation ﬁeld contains 0), these must be placed in a separate PDF stream, and
   the ﬁlter parameter listed in Table 3.10 should refer to that stream. The stream
   can be shared by multiple image XObjects whose JBIG2 encodings use the
   same global segments.

          Example 3.4 shows an image that was compressed using the JBIG2 compression
          method and then encoded in ASCII hexadecimal representation. Since the JBIG2

          indicated by the JBIG2Globals ﬁlter parameter.

This bit stream is made up of the parts listed below (in the order listed).
1. The JBIG2 ﬁle header
      97 4A 42 32 0D 0A 1A 0A 01 00 00 00 01
   Since the JBIG2 ﬁle header is not used in PDF, this header is not placed in the
   JBIG2 stream object, and is discarded.
2. The ﬁrst JBIG2 segment (segment 0)—in this case, the symbol dictionary seg-
   ment
      00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 32 00 00 03 FF FD FF 02 FE FE FE 00 00 00

      27 F2 B5 3D 4E 37 EF 79 5C C5 50 6D FF AC
   This is a global segment (segment page association = 0) and so is placed in the
   JBIG2Globals stream.
3. The page information segment
      00 00 00 01 30 00 01 00 00 00 13 00 00 00 34 00 00 00 42 00 00 00 00
      00 00 00 00 40 00 00
   and the immediate text region segment
      00 00 00 02 06 20 00 01 00 00 00 1E 00 00 00 34 00 00 00 42 00 00 00
      00 00 00 00 00 02 00 10 00 00 00 02 31 DB 51 CE 51 FF AC
   These two segments constitute the contents of the JBIG2 page, and are placed
   in the PDF XObject representing this image.
4. The end-of-page segment
      00 00 00 03 31 00 01 00 00 00 00
   and the end-of-ﬁle segment
      00 00 00 04 33 01 00 00 00 00
   Since these are not used in PDF, they are discarded.
      The resulting PDF image object, then, contains the page information segment
      and the immediate text region segment, and refers to a JBIG2Globals stream that
      contains the symbol dictionary segment.
3.3.7 DCTDecode Filter
      The DCTDecode ﬁlter decodes grayscale or color image data that has been encod-
      ed in the JPEG baseline format. (JPEG stands for the Joint Photographic Experts
      Group, a group within the International Organization for Standardization that
      developed the format; DCT stands for discrete cosine transform, the primary
      technique used in the encoding.)
      JPEG encoding is a lossy compression method, designed speciﬁcally for compres-
      sion of sampled continuous-tone images and not for general data compression.
      Data to be encoded using JPEG consists of a stream of image samples, each con-
      sisting of one, two, three, or four color components. The color component values
      for a particular sample must appear consecutively. Each component value occu-
      pies an 8-bit byte.
      During encoding, several parameters control the algorithm and the information
      loss. The values of these parameters, which include the dimensions of the image
      and the number of components per sample, are entirely under the control of the
      encoder and are stored in the encoded data. DCTDecode generally obtains the
      parameter values it requires directly from the encoded data. However, in one
      instance, the parameter might not be present in the encoded data but must be
      speciﬁed in the ﬁlter parameter dictionary; see Table 3.11.
      The details of the encoding algorithm are not presented here but can be found in
      the ISO speciﬁcation and in JPEG: Still Image Data Compression Standard, by
      Pennebaker and Mitchell (see the Bibliography). Brieﬂy, the JPEG algorithm
      breaks an image up into blocks 8 samples wide by 8 high. Each color component
      in an image is treated separately. A two-dimensional DCT is performed on each
      block. This operation produces 64 coefﬁcients, which are then quantized. Each
      coefﬁcient may be quantized with a different step size. It is this quantization that
      results in the loss of information in the JPEG algorithm. The quantized coef-
      ﬁcients are then compressed.

                                                                                                             is ignored if the image has one or two color components.
                                                                                                    Note: The RGB and YUV used here have nothing to do with the color spaces de-
                                                                                                    ﬁned as part of the Adobe imaging model. The purpose of converting from RGB
                                                                                                    to YUV is to separate luminance and chrominance information (see below).
                                                                                                    The default value of ColorTransform is 1 if the image has three components
                                                                                                    and 0 otherwise. In other words, conversion between RGB and YUV is per-
                                                                                                    formed for all three-component images unless explicitly disabled by setting
                                                                                                    ColorTransform to 0. Additionally, the encoding algorithm inserts an Adobe-
                                                                                                    deﬁned marker code in the encoded data indicating the ColorTransform value
                                                                                                    used. If present, this marker code overrides the ColorTransform value given to
                                                                                                    DCTDecode. Thus it is necessary to specify ColorTransform only when decod-
                                                                                                    ing data that does not contain the Adobe-deﬁned marker code.
           The encoding algorithm can reduce the information loss by making the step size
           in the quantization smaller at the expense of reducing the amount of compres-
           sion achieved by the algorithm. The compression achieved by the JPEG algorithm
           depends on the image being compressed and the amount of loss that is accept-
           able. In general, a compression of 15:1 can be achieved without perceptible loss
           of information, and 30:1 compression causes little impairment of the image.
           Better compression is often possible for color spaces that treat luminance and
           chrominance separately than for those that do not. The RGB-to-YUV conversion
           provided by the ﬁlters is one attempt to separate luminance and chrominance; it
           conforms to CCIR recommendation 601-1. Other color spaces, such as the CIE
           1976 L*a*b* space, may also achieve this objective. The chrominance compo-
           nents can then be compressed more than the luminance by using coarser sam-
           pling or quantization, with no degradation in quality.
    The JPEG ﬁlter implementation in Adobe Acrobat products does not support
    features of the JPEG standard that are irrelevant to images. In addition, certain
    choices have been made regarding reserved marker codes and other optional fea-
    tures of the standard. For details, see Adobe Technical Note #5116, Supporting the
    DCT Filters in PostScript Level 2.
    In addition to the baseline JPEG format, beginning with PDF 1.3 the DCTDecode
    ﬁlter supports the progressive JPEG extension. This extension does not add any
    entries to the DCTDecode parameter dictionary; the distinction between baseline
    and progressive JPEG is represented in the encoded data.
    Note: There is no beneﬁt to using progressive JPEG for stream data that is embedded
    in a PDF ﬁle. Decoding progressive JPEG is slower and consumes more memory than
    baseline JPEG. The purpose of this feature is to enable a stream to refer to an ex-
    ternal ﬁle whose data happens to be already encoded in progressive JPEG. (See also
    implementation note 10 in Appendix H.)
3.4 File Structure
    The preceding sections describe the syntax of individual objects. This section
    describes how objects are organized in a PDF ﬁle for efﬁcient random access and
    incremental update. A canonical PDF ﬁle initially consists of four elements (see
    Figure 3.2):
    • A one-line header identifying the version of the PDF speciﬁcation to which the
      ﬁle conforms
    • A body containing the objects that make up the document contained in the ﬁle
    • A cross-reference table containing information about the indirect objects in the
      ﬁle
    • A trailer giving the location of the cross-reference table and of certain special
      objects within the body of the ﬁle
    This initial structure may be modiﬁed by later updates, which append additional
    elements to the end of the ﬁle; see Section 3.4.5, “Incremental Updates,” for
    details.
                                         Header
                                          Body
                                     Cross-reference
                                          table
                                         Trailer
                       FIGURE 3.2 Initial structure of a PDF ﬁle
As a matter of convention, the tokens in a PDF ﬁle are arranged into lines; see
Section 3.1, “Lexical Conventions.” Each line is terminated by an end-of-line
(EOL) marker, which may be a carriage return (character code 13), a line feed
(character code 10), or both. PDF ﬁles with binary data may have arbitrarily long
lines. However, to increase compatibility with other applications that process
PDF ﬁles, lines that are not part of stream object data are limited to no more than
255 characters, with one exception: beginning with PDF 1.3, an exception is
made to the restriction on line length in the case of the Contents string of a signa-
ture dictionary (see “Signature Fields” on page 547). See also implementation
note 11 in Appendix H.
The rules described here are sufﬁcient to produce a well-formed PDF ﬁle. How-
ever, there are some additional rules for organizing a PDF ﬁle to enable efﬁcient
incremental access to a document’s components in a network environment. This
form of organization, called Linearized PDF, is described in Appendix F.
3.4.1 File Header
      The ﬁrst line of a PDF ﬁle is a header identifying the version of the PDF speciﬁca-
      tion to which the ﬁle conforms. For a ﬁle conforming to PDF version 1.4, the
      header should be
          %PDF−1.4
      However, since any ﬁle conforming to an earlier version of PDF also conforms to
      version 1.4, an application that processes PDF 1.4 can also accept ﬁles with any of
      the following headers:
          %PDF−1.0
          %PDF−1.1
          %PDF−1.2
          %PDF−1.3
      (See also implementation notes 12 and 13 in Appendix H.)
      In PDF 1.4, the version in the ﬁle header can be overridden by the Version entry
      in the document’s catalog dictionary (located via the Root entry in the ﬁle’s trail-
      er, as described in Section 3.4.4, “File Trailer”). This enables a PDF producer ap-
      plication to update the version using an incremental update (see Section 3.4.5,
      “Incremental Updates”).
      Under some conditions, a viewer application may be able to process PDF ﬁles
      conforming to a later version than it was designed to accept. New PDF features
      are often introduced in such a way that they can safely be ignored by a viewer that
      does not understand them (see Section H.1, “PDF Version Numbers”).
      Note: If a PDF ﬁle contains binary data, as most do (see Section 3.1, “Lexical Con-
      ventions”), it is recommended that the header line be immediately followed by a
      comment line containing at least four binary characters—that is, characters whose
      codes are 128 or greater. This will ensure proper behavior of ﬁle transfer applications
      that inspect data near the beginning of a ﬁle to determine whether to treat the ﬁle’s
      contents as text or as binary.
3.4.2 File Body
      The body of a PDF ﬁle consists of a sequence of indirect objects representing the
      contents of a document. The objects, which are of the basic types described in
      Section 3.2, “Objects,” represent components of the document such as fonts,
      pages, and sampled images.
3.4.3 Cross-Reference Table
      The cross-reference table contains information that permits random access to in-
      direct objects within the ﬁle, so that the entire ﬁle need not be read to locate any
      particular object. The table contains a one-line entry for each indirect object,
      specifying the location of that object within the body of the ﬁle.
      The cross-reference table is the only part of a PDF ﬁle with a ﬁxed format; this
      permits entries in the table to be accessed randomly. The table comprises one or
      more cross-reference sections. Initially, the entire table consists of a single section
      (or two sections if the ﬁle is linearized; see Appendix F); one additional section is
      added each time the ﬁle is updated (see Section 3.4.5, “Incremental Updates”).
      Each cross-reference section begins with a line containing the keyword xref. Fol-
      lowing this line are one or more cross-reference subsections, which may appear in
      any order. The subsection structure is useful for incremental updates, since it
      allows a new cross-reference section to be added to the PDF ﬁle, containing
      entries only for objects that have been added or deleted. For a ﬁle that has never
      been updated, the cross-reference section contains only one subsection, whose
      object numbering begins at 0.
      Each cross-reference subsection contains entries for a contiguous range of object
      numbers. The subsection begins with a line containing two numbers, separated
      by a space: the object number of the ﬁrst object in this subsection and the num-
      ber of entries in the subsection. For example, the line
         28 5
      introduces a subsection containing ﬁve objects, numbered consecutively from 28
      to 32.
      Following this line are the cross-reference entries themselves, one per line. Each
      entry is exactly 20 bytes long, including the end-of-line marker. There are two
kinds of cross-reference entry: one for objects that are in use and another for
objects that have been deleted and so are free. Both types of entry have similar
basic formats, distinguished by the keyword n (for an in-use entry) or f (for a free
entry). The format of an in-use entry is as follows:
    nnnnnnnnnn ggggg n eol
where
   nnnnnnnnnn is a 10-digit byte offset
   ggggg is a 5-digit generation number
   n is a literal keyword identifying this as an in-use entry
   eol is a 2-character end-of-line sequence
The byte offset is a 10-digit number, padded with leading zeros if necessary,
giving the number of bytes from the beginning of the ﬁle to the beginning of the
object. It is separated from the generation number by a single space. The genera-
tion number is a 5-digit number, also padded with leading zeros if necessary. Fol-
lowing the generation number is a single space, the keyword n, and then a
2-character end-of-line sequence. If the ﬁle’s end-of-line marker is a single char-
acter (either a carriage return or a line feed), it is preceded by a single space; if the
marker is 2 characters (both a carriage return and a line feed), it is not preceded
by a space. Thus the overall length of the entry is always exactly 20 bytes.
The cross-reference entry for a free object has essentially the same format, except
that the keyword is f instead of n and the interpretation of the ﬁrst item is differ-
ent:
    nnnnnnnnnn ggggg f eol
where
   nnnnnnnnnn is the 10-digit object number of the next free object
   ggggg is a 5-digit generation number
   f is a literal keyword identifying this as a free entry
   eol is a 2-character end-of-line sequence
The free entries in the cross-reference table form a linked list, with each free entry
containing the object number of the next. The ﬁrst entry in the table (object
number 0) is always free and has a generation number of 65,535; it is the head of
the linked list of free objects. The last free entry (the tail of the linked list) links
back to object number 0.
Except for object number 0, all objects in the cross-reference table initially have
generation numbers of 0. When an indirect object is deleted, its cross-reference
entry is marked free and it is added to the linked list of free entries. The entry’s
generation number is incremented by 1 to indicate the generation number to be
used the next time an object with that object number is created. Thus each time
the entry is reused, it is given a new generation number. The maximum genera-
tion number is 65,535; when a cross-reference entry reaches this value, it will
never be reused.
The cross-reference table (comprising the original cross-reference section and all
update sections) must contain one entry for each object number from 0 to the
maximum object number used in the ﬁle, even if one or more of the object num-
bers in this range do not actually occur in the ﬁle.
Example 3.5 shows a cross-reference section consisting of a single subsection with
six entries: four that are in use (objects number 1, 2, 4, and 5) and two that are
free (objects number 0 and 3). Object number 3 has been deleted, and the next
object created with that object number will be given a generation number of 7.
Example 3.5
   xref
   0 6
   0000000003   65535  f

   0000000331   00000  n
   0000000409   00000  n
Example 3.6 shows a cross-reference section with four subsections, containing a
total of ﬁve entries. The ﬁrst subsection contains one entry, for object number 0,
which is free. The second subsection contains one entry, for object number 3,
which is in use. The third subsection contains two entries, for objects number 23
and 24, both of which are in use. Object number 23 has been reused, as can be
seen from the fact that it has a generation number of 2. The fourth subsection
contains one entry, for object number 30, which is in use.

3.4.4 File Trailer
      The trailer of a PDF ﬁle enables an application reading the ﬁle to quickly ﬁnd the
      cross-reference table and certain special objects. Applications should read a PDF
      ﬁle from its end. The last line of the ﬁle contains only the end-of-ﬁle marker,
      %%EOF. (See implementation note 14 in Appendix H.) The two preceding lines
      contain the keyword startxref and the byte offset from the beginning of the ﬁle to
      the beginning of the xref keyword in the last cross-reference section. The startxref
      line is preceded by the trailer dictionary, consisting of the keyword trailer followed
      by a series of key-value pairs enclosed in double angle brackets (<< … >>). Thus
      the trailer has the following overall structure:
         trailer
             << key1 value1
                 key2 value2
                 …
                 keyn valuen
             >>
         startxref
         Byte_offset_of_last_cross-reference_section
         %%EOF
      Table 3.12 lists the contents of the trailer dictionary; Example 3.7 shows an ex-
      ample trailer for a ﬁle that has never been updated (as indicated by the absence of
      a Prev entry in the trailer dictionary).

   3.4.5 Incremental Updates
         The contents of a PDF ﬁle can be updated incrementally, without rewriting the
         entire ﬁle. Changes are appended to the end of the ﬁle, leaving its original con-
         tents intact. The main advantage to updating a ﬁle in this way (as discussed in
Section 2.2.7, “Incremental Update”) is that it enables small changes to a large
document to be saved quickly. Other advantages include the following:
• In some cases, incremental updating is the only way to save changes to a docu-
  ment. An accepted practice for minimizing the risk of data loss when saving a
  document is to write it to a new ﬁle and then rename the new ﬁle to replace the
  old one; however, in certain contexts, such as when editing a document across
  an HTTP connection or using OLE embedding (a Windows-speciﬁc technolo-
  gy), it is not possible to overwrite the contents of the original ﬁle in this man-
  ner. Incremental updates can be used to save changes to documents in these
  contexts.
• Once a document has been signed (see Section 2.2.6, “Security”), all changes
  made to the document must be saved using incremental updates, since altering
  any existing bytes in the ﬁle will invalidate existing signatures.
In an incremental update, any new or changed objects are appended to the ﬁle, a
cross-reference section is added, and a new trailer is inserted. The resulting ﬁle
has the structure shown in Figure 3.3. A complete example of an updated ﬁle is
shown in Section G.6, “Updating Example.”
The cross-reference section added when a ﬁle is updated contains entries only for
objects that have been changed, replaced, or deleted, plus the entry for object 0.
Deleted objects are left unchanged in the ﬁle, but are marked as deleted via their
cross-reference entries. The added trailer contains all the entries (perhaps modi-
ﬁed) from the previous trailer, as well as a Prev entry giving the location of the
previous cross-reference section (see Table 3.12 on page 68). As shown in Figure
3.3, a ﬁle that has been updated several times contains several trailers; note that
each trailer is terminated by its own end-of-ﬁle (%%EOF) marker.
Because updates are appended to PDF ﬁles, it is possible to end up with several
copies of an object with the same object identiﬁer (object number and generation
number). This can occur, for example, if a text annotation (see Section 8.4,
“Annotations”) is changed several times, with the ﬁle being saved between chang-
es. Because the text annotation object is not deleted, it retains the same object
number and generation number as before. An updated copy of the object is in-
cluded in the new update section added to the ﬁle; the update’s cross-reference
section includes a byte offset to this new copy of the object, overriding the old
byte offset contained in the original cross-reference section. When a viewer appli-
cation reads the ﬁle, it must build its cross-reference information in such a way
that the most recent copy of each object is the one accessed in the ﬁle.

                     FIGURE 3.3 Structure of an updated PDF ﬁle
In versions of PDF prior to 1.4, it was not possible to use an incremental update
to alter the version of PDF to which the document conforms, since the version
was speciﬁed only in the header at the beginning of the ﬁle (see Section 3.4.1,
“File Header”). In PDF 1.4, it is possible for a Version entry in the document’s
catalog dictionary (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Catalog”) to override the ver-
    sion speciﬁed in the header; this enables the version to be altered using an incre-
    mental update.
3.5 Encryption
    A PDF document can be encrypted (PDF 1.1) to protect its contents from un-
    authorized access. Encryption applies to all strings and streams in the document’s
    PDF ﬁle, but not to other object types such as integers and boolean values, which
    are used primarily to convey information about the document’s structure rather
    than its content. Leaving these values unencrypted allows random access to the
    objects within a document, while encrypting the strings and streams protects the
    document’s substantive contents.
    Note: When a PDF stream object (see Section 3.2.7, “Stream Objects”) refers to an
    external ﬁle, the stream’s contents are not encrypted, since they are not part of the
    PDF ﬁle itself. However, if the contents of the stream are embedded within the PDF
    ﬁle (see Section 3.10.3, “Embedded File Streams”), they are encrypted like any other
    stream in the ﬁle.
    Encryption is controlled by an encryption dictionary, which is the value of the
    Encrypt entry in the document’s trailer dictionary (see Table 3.12 on page 68).
    The absence of this entry from the trailer dictionary means that the document is
    not encrypted. The entries shown in Table 3.13 are common to all encryption
    dictionaries.
    The encryption dictionary’s Filter entry identiﬁes the ﬁle’s security handler, a soft-
    ware module that implements various aspects of the encryption process and con-
    trols access to the contents of the encrypted document. PDF speciﬁes a standard
    security handler that all viewer applications are expected to support, but applica-
    tions may optionally substitute security handlers of their own.
    The V entry, in specifying which algorithm to use, determines the length or
    lengths allowed for the encryption key, on which the encryption (and decryp-
    tion) of data in a PDF ﬁle is based. If more than one length is allowed (that is, for
    V values 2 and 3), the Length entry speciﬁes the exact length of the encryption
    key.
    The remaining contents of the encryption dictionary are determined by the secu-
    rity handler, and may vary from one handler to another. Those for the standard
    security handler are described in Section 3.5.2, “Standard Security Handler.”

         Unlike strings within the body of the document, those in the encryption diction-
         ary must be direct objects and are not encrypted by the usual methods. The secu-
         rity handler itself is responsible for encrypting and decrypting strings in the
         encryption dictionary, using whatever encryption algorithm it chooses.
         Note: Document creators have two choices if the standard security handler and en-
         cryption methods provided by PDF are not sufﬁcient for their needs: they can pro-
         vide an alternate, more secure security handler or they can encrypt whole PDF
         documents themselves, not making use of PDF security.
   3.5.1 General Encryption Algorithm
         PDF’s standard encryption methods use the MD5 message-digest algorithm
         (described in Internet RFC 1321, The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm; see the
         Bibliography) and a proprietary encryption algorithm known as RC4. RC4 is a
symmetric stream cipher: the same algorithm is used for both encryption and de-
cryption, and the algorithm does not change the length of the data.
Note: RC4 is a copyrighted, proprietary algorithm of RSA Security, Inc. Adobe Sys-
tems has licensed this algorithm for use in its Acrobat products. Independent soft-
ware vendors may be required to license RC4 in order to develop software that
encrypts or decrypts PDF documents. For further information, visit the RSA Web site
at <http://www.rsasecurity.com> or send e-mail to <products@rsasecurity.com>.
The encryption of data in a PDF ﬁle is based on the use of an encryption key com-
puted by the security handler. Different security handlers can compute the en-
cryption key in a variety of ways, more or less cryptographically secure.
Regardless of how the key is computed, its use in the encryption of data is always
the same (see Algorithm 3.1). Because the RC4 algorithm is symmetric, this same
sequence of steps can be used both to encrypt and to decrypt data.
Algorithm 3.1 Encryption of data using an encryption key
    1.  Obtain the object number and generation number from the object identiﬁer of
        the string or stream to be encrypted (see Section 3.2.9, “Indirect Objects”). If the
        string is a direct object, use the identiﬁer of the indirect object containing it.
    2.  Treating the object number and generation number as binary integers, extend the
        original n-byte encryption key to n + 5 bytes by appending the low-order 3 bytes
        of the object number and the low-order 2 bytes of the generation number in that
        order, low-order byte ﬁrst. (n is 5 unless the value of V in the encryption diction-
        ary is greater than 1, in which case n is the value of Length divided by 8.)
    3.  Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step 2 as input to this func-
        tion.
    4.  Use the ﬁrst (n + 5) bytes, up to a maximum of 16, of the output from the MD5
        hash as the key for the RC4 encryption function, along with the string or stream
        data to be encrypted. The output is the encrypted data to be stored in the PDF ﬁle.
Stream data is encrypted after applying all stream encoding ﬁlters, and is de-
crypted before applying any stream decoding ﬁlters; the number of bytes to be
encrypted or decrypted is given by the Length entry in the stream dictionary.
Decryption of strings (other than those in the encryption dictionary) is done
after escape-sequence processing and hexadecimal decoding as appropriate to the
string representation described in Section 3.2.3, “String Objects.”
3.5.2 Standard Security Handler
      PDF’s standard security handler allows access permissions and up to two pass-
      words to be speciﬁed for a document: an owner password and a user password. An
      application’s decision to encrypt a document is based on whether the user creat-
      ing the document speciﬁes any passwords or access restrictions (for example, in a
      security settings dialog that the user can invoke before saving the PDF ﬁle); if so,
      the document is encrypted, and the permissions and information required to val-
      idate the passwords are stored in the encryption dictionary. (An application may
      also create an encrypted document without any user interaction, if it has some
      other source of information about what passwords and permissions to use.)
      If a user attempts to open an encrypted document that has a user password, the
      viewer application should prompt for a password. Correctly supplying either
      password allows the user to open the document, decrypt it, and display it on the
      screen. If the document does not have a user password, no password is requested;
      the viewer application can simply open, decrypt, and display the document.
      Whether additional operations are allowed on a decrypted document depends on
      which password (if any) was supplied when the document was opened and on
      any access restrictions that were speciﬁed when the document was created:
      • Opening the document with the correct owner password (assuming it is not
         the same as the user password) allows full (owner) access to the document.
         This unlimited access includes the ability to change the document’s passwords
         and access permissions.
      • Opening the document with the correct user password (or opening a docu-
         ment that does not have a user password) allows additional operations to be
         performed according to the user access permissions speciﬁed in the document’s
         encryption dictionary.
      Access permissions are speciﬁed in the form of ﬂags corresponding to the various
      operations, and the set of operations to which they correspond depends in turn
      on the security handler’s revision number (also stored in the encryption diction-
      ary). If the revision number is 2, the operations to which user access can be con-
      trolled are as follows:
      • Modifying the document’s contents
      • Copying or otherwise extracting text and graphics from the document, includ-
         ing extraction for accessibility purposes (that is, to make the contents of the
   document accessible through assistive technologies such as screen readers or
   Braille output devices; see Section 9.8, “Accessibility Support”)
• Adding or modifying text annotations (“sticky notes”; see “Text Annotations”
   on page 499) and interactive form ﬁelds (Section 8.6, “Interactive Forms”)
• Printing the document
If the security handler’s revision number is 3, user access to the following opera-
tions can be controlled more selectively:
• Filling in forms (that is, ﬁlling in existing interactive form ﬁelds) and signing
   the document (which amounts to ﬁlling in existing signature ﬁelds, a type of
   interactive form ﬁeld)
• Assembling the document: inserting, rotating, or deleting pages and creating
   navigation elements such as bookmarks or thumbnail images (see Section 8.2,
   “Document-Level Navigation”)
• Printing to a representation from which a faithful digital copy of the PDF con-
   tent could be generated. Disallowing such printing may result in degradation
   of output quality (a feature implemented as “Print As Image” in Acrobat)
In addition, revision 3 enables the extraction of text and graphics (in support of
accessibility to disabled users or for other purposes) to be controlled separately.
Note: Once the document has been opened and decrypted successfully, the viewer ap-
plication has access to the entire contents of the document. There is nothing inherent
in PDF encryption that enforces the document permissions speciﬁed in the encryp-
tion dictionary. It is up to the implementors of PDF viewer applications to respect the
intent of the document creator by restricting user access to an encrypted PDF ﬁle ac-
cording to the permissions contained in the ﬁle.

        The values of the O and U entries in this dictionary are used to determine wheth-
        er a password entered when the document is opened is the correct owner pass-
        word, user password, or neither.
        The value of the P entry is an unsigned 32-bit integer containing a set of ﬂags
        specifying which access permissions should be granted when the document is
        opened with user access. Table 3.15 shows the meanings of these ﬂags. Bit posi-
        tions within the ﬂag word are numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (high-order); a
        1 bit in any position enables the corresponding access permission. Which bits are
        meaningful, and in some cases how they are interpreted, depends on the security
        handler’s revision number (speciﬁed in the encryption dictionary’s R entry).
        Note: PDF integer objects in fact are represented internally in signed twos-
        complement form. Since all the reserved high-order ﬂag bits in the encryption
        dictionary’s P value are required to be 1, the value must be speciﬁed as a negative
        integer. For example, assuming revision 2 of the security handler, the value -44 al-
        lows printing and copying but disallows modifying the contents and annotations.

Encryption Key Algorithm
As noted earlier, one function of a security handler is to generate an encryption
key for use in encrypting and decrypting the contents of a document. Given a
password string, the standard security handler computes an encryption key as
shown in Algorithm 3.2.
Algorithm 3.2 Computing an encryption key
    1.  Pad or truncate the password string to exactly 32 bytes. If the password string is
        more than 32 bytes long, use only its ﬁrst 32 bytes; if it is less than 32 bytes long,
        pad it by appending the required number of additional bytes from the beginning
        of the following padding string:
             < 28 BF 4E 5E 4E 75 8A 41 64 00 4E 56 FF FA 01 08
                2E 2E 00 B6 D0 68 3E 80 2F 0C A9 FE 64 53 69 7A >
        That is, if the password string is n bytes long, append the ﬁrst 32 − n bytes of the
        padding string to the end of the password string. If the password string is empty
        (zero-length), meaning there is no user password, substitute the entire padding
        string in its place.
    2.  Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step 1 as input to this func-
        tion.
    3.  Pass the value of the encryption dictionary’s O entry to the MD5 hash function.
        (Algorithm 3.3 shows how the O value is computed.)
    4.  Treat the value of the P entry as an unsigned 4-byte integer and pass these bytes to
        the MD5 hash function, low-order byte ﬁrst.
    5.  Pass the ﬁrst element of the ﬁle’s ﬁle identiﬁer array (the value of the ID entry in
        the document’s trailer dictionary; see Table 3.12 on page 68) to the MD5 hash
        function and ﬁnish the hash.
    6.  (Revision 3 only) Do the following 50 times: Take the output from the previous
        MD5 hash and pass it as input into a new MD5 hash.
    7.  Set the encryption key to the ﬁrst n bytes of the output from the ﬁnal MD5 hash,
        where n is always 5 for revision 2 but for revision 3 depends on the value of the en-
        cryption dictionary’s Length entry.
This algorithm, when applied to the user password string, produces the encryp-
tion key used to encrypt or decrypt string and stream data according to Algo-
rithm 3.1 on page 73. Parts of this algorithm are also used in the algorithms
described below.
Password Algorithms
In addition to the encryption key, the standard security handler must provide the
contents of the encryption dictionary (Tables 3.13 on page 72 and 3.14 on page
76). The values of the Filter, V, Length, R, and P entries are straightforward, but
the computation of the O (owner password) and U (user password) entries re-
quires further explanation. Algorithms 3.3 through 3.5 show how the values of
the owner password and user password entries are computed (with separate ver-
sions of the latter for revisions 2 and 3 of the security handler).
Algorithm 3.3 Computing the encryption dictionary’s O (owner password) value
   1.   Pad or truncate the owner password string as described in step 1 of Algorithm 3.2.
        If there is no owner password, use the user password instead. (See implementa-
        tion note 17 in Appendix H.)
   2.   Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the result of step 1 as input to this func-
        tion.
   3.   (Revision 3 only) Do the following 50 times: Take the output from the previous
        MD5 hash and pass it as input into a new MD5 hash.
   4.   Create an RC4 encryption key using the ﬁrst n bytes of the output from the ﬁnal
        MD5 hash, where n is always 5 for revision 2 but for revision 3 depends on the
        value of the encryption dictionary’s Length entry.
   5.   Pad or truncate the user password string as described in step 1 of Algorithm 3.2.
   6.   Encrypt the result of step 5, using an RC4 encryption function with the encryp-
        tion key obtained in step 4.
   7.   (Revision 3 only) Do the following 19 times: Take the output from the previous in-
        vocation of the RC4 function and pass it as input to a new invocation of the func-
        tion; use an encryption key generated by taking each byte of the encryption key
        obtained in step 4 and performing an XOR (exclusive or) operation between that
        byte and the single-byte value of the iteration counter (from 1 to 19).
   8.   Store the output from the ﬁnal invocation of the RC4 function as the value of the
        O entry in the encryption dictionary.
Algorithm 3.4 Computing the encryption dictionary’s U (user password) value (Revision 2)
   1.   Create an encryption key based on the user password string, as described in Algo-
        rithm 3.2.
   2.   Encrypt the 32-byte padding string shown in step 1 of Algorithm 3.2, using an
        RC4 encryption function with the encryption key from the preceding step.
   3.   Store the result of step 2 as the value of the U entry in the encryption dictionary.
Algorithm 3.5 Computing the encryption dictionary’s U (user password) value (Revision 3)
   1.   Create an encryption key based on the user password string, as described in Algo-
        rithm 3.2.
   2.   Initialize the MD5 hash function and pass the 32-byte padding string shown in
        step 1 of Algorithm 3.2 as input to this function.
   3.   Pass the ﬁrst element of the ﬁle’s ﬁle identiﬁer array (the value of the ID entry in
        the document’s trailer dictionary; see Table 3.12 on page 68) to the hash function
        and ﬁnish the hash.
   4.   Encrypt the 16-byte result of the hash, using an RC4 encryption function with the
        encryption key from step 1.
   5.   Do the following 19 times: Take the output from the previous invocation of the
        RC4 function and pass it as input to a new invocation of the function; use an en-
        cryption key generated by taking each byte of the original encryption key (ob-
        tained in step 1) and performing an XOR (exclusive or) operation between that
        byte and the single-byte value of the iteration counter (from 1 to 19).
   6.   Append 16 bytes of arbitrary padding to the output from the ﬁnal invocation of
        the RC4 function and store the 32-byte result as the value of the U entry in the en-
        cryption dictionary.
The standard security handler uses Algorithms 3.6 and 3.7 to determine whether
a supplied password string is the correct user or owner password. Note too that
Algorithm 3.6 can be used to determine whether a document’s user password is
the empty string, and therefore whether to suppress prompting for a password
when the document is opened.
Algorithm 3.6 Authenticating the user password
   1.   Perform all but the last step of Algorithm 3.4 (Revision 2) or Algorithm 3.5 (Revi-
        sion 3) using the supplied password string.
   2.   If the result of step 1 is equal to the value of the encryption dictionary’s U entry
        (comparing on the ﬁrst 16 bytes in the case of Revision 3), the password supplied
        is the correct user password. The key obtained in step 1 (that is, in the ﬁrst step of
        Algorithm 3.4 or 3.5) can be used to decrypt the document using Algorithm 3.1
        on page 73.
    Algorithm 3.7 Authenticating the owner password
        1.  Compute an encryption key from the supplied password string, as described in
            steps 1 to 4 of Algorithm 3.3.
        2.  (Revision 2 only) Decrypt the value of the encryption dictionary’s O entry, using
            an RC4 encryption function with the encryption key computed in step 1.
            (Revision 3 only) Do the following 20 times: Decrypt the value of the encryption
            dictionary’s O entry (ﬁrst iteration) or the output from the previous iteration (all
            subsequent iterations), using an RC4 encryption function with a different encryp-
            tion key at each iteration. The key is generated by taking the original key (ob-
            tained in step 1) and performing an XOR (exclusive or) operation between each
            byte of the key and the single-byte value of the iteration counter (from 19 to 0).
        3.  The result of step 2 purports to be the user password. Authenticate this user pass-
            word using Algorithm 3.6. If it is found to be correct, the password supplied is the
            correct owner password.
3.6 Document Structure
    A PDF document can be regarded as a hierarchy of objects contained in the body
    section of a PDF ﬁle. At the root of the hierarchy is the document’s catalog
    dictionary (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Catalog”). Most of the objects in the
    hierarchy are dictionaries. For example, each page of the document is represent-
    ed by a page object—a dictionary that includes references to the page’s contents
    and other attributes, such as its thumbnail image (Section 8.2.3, “Thumbnail
    Images”) and any annotations (Section 8.4, “Annotations”) associated with it.
    The individual page objects are tied together in a structure called the page tree
    (described in Section 3.6.2, “Page Tree”), which in turn is located via an indirect
    reference in the document catalog. Parent, child, and sibling relationships within
    the hierarchy are deﬁned by dictionary entries whose values are indirect refer-
    ences to other dictionaries. Figure 3.4 illustrates the structure of the object hier-
    archy.
    Note: The data structures described in this section, particularly the catalog and page
    dictionaries, combine entries describing document structure with ones dealing with
    the detailed semantics of documents and pages. All entries are listed here, but many
    of their descriptions are deferred to subsequent chapters.

  3.6.1 Document Catalog
          The root of a document’s object hierarchy is the catalog dictionary, located via the
          Root entry in the trailer of the PDF ﬁle (see Section 3.4.4, “File Trailer”). The cat-
          alog contains references to other objects deﬁning the document’s contents, out-
          line, article threads (PDF 1.1), named destinations, and other attributes. In
          addition, it contains information about how the document should be displayed
          on the screen, such as whether its outline and thumbnail page images should be
          displayed automatically and whether some location other than the ﬁrst page
          should be shown when the document is opened. Table 3.16 shows the entries in
          the catalog dictionary.

  3.6.2 Page Tree
        The pages of a document are accessed through a structure known as the page tree,
        which deﬁnes their ordering within the document. The tree structure allows PDF
        viewer applications to quickly open a document containing thousands of pages
        using only limited memory. The tree contains nodes of two types—intermediate
        nodes, called page tree nodes, and leaf nodes, called page objects—whose form is
        described in the sections below. Viewer applications should be prepared to han-
        dle any form of tree structure built of such nodes. The simplest structure would
        consist of a single page tree node that references all of the document’s page
        objects directly; however, to optimize the performance of viewer applications, the
        Acrobat Distiller and PDF Writer programs construct trees of a particular form,
        known as balanced trees. Further information on this form of tree can be found in
        Data Structures and Algorithms, by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman (see the Bibliog-
        raphy).
        Page Tree Nodes
        Table 3.17 shows the required entries in a page tree node.
                            TABLE 3.17 Required entries in a page tree node

                                                                                                    The children may be page objects or other page tree nodes.
Count                                   integer                                                     (Required) The number of leaf nodes (page objects) that are descendants of this
                                                                                                    node within the page tree.
        Note: The structure of the page tree is not necessarily related to the logical structure
        of the document itself; that is, page tree nodes do not represent chapters, sections, and
        so forth. (Other data structures are deﬁned for that purpose; see Section 9.6, “Logical
        Structure.”) Applications that consume or produce PDF ﬁles are not required to pre-
        serve the existing structure of the page tree.
Example 3.9 illustrates the page tree for a document with three pages. See “Page
Objects,” below, for the contents of the individual page objects, and Section G.4,
“Page Tree Example,” for a more extended example showing the page tree for a
longer document.

In addition to the entries shown in Table 3.17, a page tree node may contain fur-
ther entries deﬁning inherited attributes for the page objects that are its descen-
dants (see “Inheritance of Page Attributes” on page 91).
Page Objects
The leaves of the page tree are page objects, each of which is a dictionary specify-
ing the attributes of a single page of the document. Table 3.18 shows the contents
of this dictionary (see also implementation note 21 in Appendix H). The table
          also identiﬁes which attributes a page may inherit from its ancestor nodes in the
          page tree, as described under “Inheritance of Page Attributes” on page 91.
          Attributes that are not explicitly identiﬁed in the table as inheritable cannot be
          inherited.

Inheritance of Page Attributes
Some of the page attributes shown in Table 3.18 are designated as inheritable. If
such an attribute is omitted from a page object, its value is inherited from an an-
cestor node in the page tree. If the attribute is a required one, a value must be
supplied in an ancestor node; if it is optional and no inherited value is speciﬁed,
the default value is used.
An attribute can thus be deﬁned once for a whole set of pages, by specifying it in
an intermediate page tree node and arranging the pages that share the attribute as
descendants of that node. For example, a document might specify the same
media box for all of its pages by including a MediaBox entry in the root node of
the page tree. If necessary, an individual page object could then override this in-
herited value with a MediaBox entry of its own.
Note: In a document conforming to the Linearized PDF organization (see Appen-
dix F), all page attributes must be speciﬁed explicitly as entries in the page diction-
aries to which they apply; they may not be inherited from an ancestor node.
Figure 3.5 illustrates the inheritance of attributes. In the page tree shown, pages 1,
2, and 4 are rotated clockwise by 90 degrees, page 3 by 270 degrees, page 6 by 180
degrees, and pages 5 and 7 not at all (0 degrees).

3.6.3 Name Dictionary
       Some categories of objects in a PDF ﬁle can be referred to by name rather than by
       object reference. The correspondence between names and objects is established
       by the document’s name dictionary (PDF 1.2), located via the Names entry in the
       document’s catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Catalog”). Each entry in this
       dictionary designates the root of a name tree (Section 3.8.4, “Name Trees”) de-
       ﬁning names for a particular category of objects. Table 3.19 shows the contents of
       the name dictionary.
 3.7 Content Streams and Resources
       Content streams are the primary means for describing the appearance of pages
       and other graphical elements. A content stream depends on information con-
       tained in an associated resource dictionary; in combination, these two objects
       form a self-contained entity. This section describes these objects.

  3.7.1 Content Streams
           A content stream is a PDF stream object whose data consists of a sequence of in-
           structions describing the graphical elements to be painted on a page. The instruc-
           tions are represented in the form of PDF objects, using the same object syntax as
           in the rest of the PDF document. However, whereas the document as a whole is a
           static, random-access data structure, the objects in the content stream are intend-
           ed to be interpreted and acted upon sequentially.
           Each page of a document is represented by one or more content streams. Content
           streams are also used to package up sequences of instructions as self-contained
           graphical elements, such as forms (see Section 4.9, “Form XObjects”), patterns
           (Section 4.6, “Patterns”), certain fonts (Section 5.5.4, “Type 3 Fonts”), and anno-
           tation appearances (Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”).
A content stream, after decoding with any speciﬁed ﬁlters, is interpreted accord-
ing to the PDF syntax rules described in Section 3.1, “Lexical Conventions.” It
consists of PDF objects denoting operands and operators. The operands needed
by an operator precede it in the stream. See Example 3.3 on page 43 for an exam-
ple of a content stream.
An operand is a direct object belonging to any of the basic PDF data types except
a stream. Dictionaries are permitted as operands only by certain speciﬁc opera-
tors. Indirect objects and object references are not permitted at all.
An operator is a PDF keyword that speciﬁes some action to be performed, such as
painting a graphical shape on the page. An operator keyword is distinguished
from a name object by the absence of an initial slash character (/ ). Operators are
meaningful only inside a content stream.
Note: This “postﬁx” notation, in which an operator is preceded by its operands, is
superﬁcially the same as in the PostScript language. However, PDF has no concept of
an operand stack as PostScript has. In PDF, all of the operands needed by an opera-
tor must immediately precede that operator. Operators do not return results, and
there may not be operands left over when an operator ﬁnishes execution.
Most operators have to do with painting graphical elements on the page or with
specifying parameters that affect subsequent painting operations. The individual
operators are described in the chapters devoted to their functions:
• Chapter 4 describes operators that paint general graphics, such as ﬁlled areas,
  strokes, and sampled images, and that specify device-independent graphical
  parameters, such as color.
• Chapter 5 describes operators that paint text using character glyphs deﬁned in
  fonts.
• Chapter 6 describes operators that specify device-dependent rendering param-
  eters.
• Chapter 9 describes the marked-content operators that associate higher-level
  logical information with objects in the content stream. These operators do not
  affect the rendered appearance of the content; rather, they specify information
  useful to applications that use PDF for document interchange.
         Ordinarily, when a viewer application encounters an operator in a content stream
         that it does not recognize, an error will occur. (See implementation note 25 in
         Appendix H.) A pair of compatibility operators, BX and EX (PDF 1.1), modify
         this behavior (see Table 3.20). These operators must occur in pairs and may be
         nested. They bracket a compatibility section, a portion of a content stream within
         which unrecognized operators are to be ignored without error. This mechanism
         enables a PDF document to use operators deﬁned in newer versions of PDF with-
         out sacriﬁcing compatibility with older viewers; it should be used only in cases
         where ignoring such newer operators is the appropriate thing to do. The BX and
         EX operators are not themselves part of any graphics object (see Section 4.1,
         “Graphics Objects”) or of the graphics state (Section 4.3, “Graphics State”).

                          operands) will be ignored without error until the balancing EX operator is encoun-
                          tered.
—               EX        (PDF 1.1) End a compatibility section begun by a balancing BX operator.
  3.7.2 Resource Dictionaries
         As stated above, the operands supplied to operators in a content stream may only
         be direct objects; indirect objects and object references are not permitted. In
         some cases, an operator needs to refer to a PDF object that is deﬁned outside the
         content stream, such as a font dictionary or a stream containing image data. This
         can be accomplished by deﬁning such objects as named resources and referring to
         them by name from within the content stream.
         Note: Named resources are meaningful only in the context of a content stream. The
         scope of a resource name is local to a particular content stream, and is unrelated to
         externally known identiﬁers for objects such as fonts. References from one object to
         another outside of content streams should be made by means of indirect object refer-
         ences rather than named resources.
         A content stream’s named resources are deﬁned by a resource dictionary, which
         enumerates the named resources needed by the operators in the content stream
         and the names by which they can be referred to. For example, if a text operator
appearing within the content stream needed a certain font, the content stream’s
resource dictionary might associate the name F42 with the corresponding font
dictionary. The text operator could then use this name to refer to the font.
A resource dictionary is associated with a content stream in one of the following
ways:
• For a content stream that is the value of a page’s      Contents entry (or is an
   element of an array that is the value of that entry), the resource dictionary is
   designated by the page dictionary’s Resources entry. (Since a page’s Resources
   attribute is inheritable, as described under “Inheritance of Page Attributes” on
   page 91, it may actually reside in some ancestor node of the page object.)
• For other content streams, the resource dictionary is speciﬁed by the Resources
   entry in the stream dictionary of the content stream itself. This applies to con-
   tent streams that deﬁne form XObjects, patterns, Type 3 fonts, and annotation
   appearances.
• A form XObject or a Type 3 font’s glyph description may omit the Resources
   entry, in which case resources will be looked up in the Resources entry of the
   page on which the form or font is used. This practice is not recommended.
In the context of a given content stream, the term current resource dictionary
refers to the resource dictionary associated with the stream in one of the ways
described above.
Each key in a resource dictionary is the name of a resource type, as shown in
Table 3.21. For most resource types, the corresponding value is a subdictionary
whose keys, in turn, are the names of resources of the given type and whose
values are the PDF objects representing those resources. (For resource type
ProcSet, the value is an array of procedure set names instead of a subdictionary.)
Example 3.11 shows a resource dictionary containing procedure sets, fonts, and
external objects. The procedure sets are speciﬁed by an array, as described in Sec-
tion 9.1, “Procedure Sets.” The fonts are speciﬁed with a subdictionary associat-
ing the names F5, F6, F7, and F8 with objects 6, 8, 10, and 12, respectively.
Likewise, the XObject subdictionary associates the names Im1 and Im2 with ob-
jects 13 and 15, respectively.

 3.8 Common Data Structures
      As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, there are some general-purpose
      data structures that are built from the basic object types described in Section 3.2,
      “Objects,” and are used in many places throughout PDF. This section describes
      data structures for text strings, dates, rectangles, name trees, and number trees.
      The subsequent two sections describe more complex data structures for func-
      tions and ﬁle speciﬁcations.
      All of these data structures are meaningful only as part of the document hier-
      archy; they cannot appear within content streams. In particular, the special con-
      ventions for interpreting the values of string objects apply only to strings outside
      content streams. An entirely different convention is used within content streams
      for using strings to select sequences of glyphs to be painted on the page (see
      Chapter 5). Table 3.22 summarizes the basic and higher-level data types that are
      used throughout this book to describe the values of dictionary entries and other
      PDF data values.
3.8.1 Text Strings
      Certain strings contain information that is intended to be human-readable, such
      as text annotations, bookmark names, article names, document information, and
      so forth. Such strings are referred to as text strings. Text strings are encoded in
      either PDFDocEncoding or Unicode character encoding. PDFDocEncoding is a
      superset of the ISO Latin 1 encoding and is documented in Appendix D. Unicode
      is described in the Unicode Standard by the Unicode Consortium (see the Bibli-
      ography).
      For text strings encoded in Unicode, the ﬁrst two bytes must be 254 followed by
      255, representing the Unicode byte order marker, U+FEFF. (This sequence con-
      ﬂicts with the PDFDocEncoding character sequence thorn ydieresis, which is un-
      likely to be a meaningful beginning of a word or phrase.) The remainder of the
      string consists of Unicode character codes, according to the UTF-16 encoding
      speciﬁed in the Unicode standard, version 2.0. Commonly used Unicode values
      are represented as 2 bytes per character, with the high-order byte appearing ﬁrst
      in the string.

Anywhere in a Unicode text string, an escape sequence may appear to indicate the
language in which subsequent text is written; this is useful when the language
cannot be determined from the character codes used in the text itself. The escape
sequence consists of the following elements, in order:
1. The Unicode value U+001B (that is, the byte sequence 0 followed by 27)
2. A 2-character ISO 639 language code—for example, en for English or ja for
    Japanese
3. (Optional) A 2-character ISO 3166 country code—for example, US for the
    United States or JP for Japan
4. The Unicode value U+001B
      The complete list of codes deﬁned by ISO 639 and ISO 3166 can be obtained
      from the International Organization for Standardization (see the Bibliography).
3.8.2 Dates
      PDF deﬁnes a standard date format, which closely follows that of the internation-
      al standard ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One), deﬁned in ISO/IEC 8824 (see
      the Bibliography). A date is a string of the form
          (D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSSOHH'mm')
      where
         YYYY is the year
         MM is the month
         DD is the day (01–31)
         HH is the hour (00–23)
         mm is the minute (00–59)
         SS is the second (00–59)
         O is the relationship of local time to Universal Time (UT), denoted by one of
         the characters +, −, or Z (see below)
         HH followed by ' is the absolute value of the offset from UT in hours (00–23)
         mm followed by ' is the absolute value of the offset from UT in minutes (00–59)
      The apostrophe character ( ' ) after HH and mm is part of the syntax. All ﬁelds after
      the year are optional. (The preﬁx D: , although also optional, is strongly recom-
      mended.) The default values for MM and DD are both 01; all other numerical
      ﬁelds default to zero values. A plus sign (+) as the value of the O ﬁeld signiﬁes that
      local time is later than UT, a minus sign (−) that local time is earlier than UT, and
      the letter Z that local time is equal to UT. If no UT information is speciﬁed, the
      relationship of the speciﬁed time to UT is considered to be unknown. Whether or
      not the time zone is known, the rest of the date should be speciﬁed in local time.
      For example, December 23, 1998, at 7:52 PM, U.S. Paciﬁc Standard Time, is rep-
      resented by the string
          D:199812231952−08'00'
3.8.3 Rectangles
      Rectangles are used to describe locations on a page and bounding boxes for a
      variety of objects, such as fonts. A rectangle is written as an array of four numbers
      giving the coordinates of a pair of diagonally opposite corners. Typically, the
      array takes the form
          [llx lly urx ury ]
      specifying the lower-left x, lower-left y, upper-right x, and upper-right y coordi-
      nates of the rectangle, in that order.
      Note: Although rectangles are conventionally speciﬁed by their lower-left and upper-
      right corners, it is acceptable to specify any two diagonally opposite corners. Applica-
      tions that process PDF should be prepared to normalize such rectangles in situations
      where speciﬁc corners are required.
3.8.4 Name Trees
      A name tree serves a similar purpose to a dictionary—associating keys and
      values—but by different means. A name tree differs from a dictionary in the fol-
      lowing important ways:
      • Unlike the keys in a dictionary, which are name objects, those in a name tree
         are strings.
      • The keys are ordered.
      • The values associated with the keys may be objects of any type, but they must
         always be speciﬁed via indirect object references.
      • The data structure can represent an arbitrarily large collection of key-value
         pairs, which can be looked up efﬁciently without requiring the entire data
         structure to be read from the PDF ﬁle. (In contrast, a dictionary is subject to an
         implementation limit on the number of entries it can contain.)
      A name tree is constructed of nodes, each of which is a dictionary object. Table
      3.23 shows the entries in a node dictionary. The nodes are of three kinds,
      depending on the speciﬁc entries they contain. The tree always has exactly one
      root node, which contains a single entry: either Kids or Names but not both. If the
      root node has a Names entry, it is the only node in the tree. If it has a Kids entry,
       then each of the remaining nodes is either an intermediate node, containing a
       Limits entry and a Kids entry, or a leaf node, containing a Limits entry and a
       Names entry.

                                                                                                    is not present) An array of the form
                                                                                                        [key1 value1 key2 value2 … keyn valuen ]
                                                                                                    where each keyi is a string and the corresponding valuei is an indirect reference to the
                                                                                                    object associated with that key. The keys are sorted in lexical order, as described below.
Limits                                  array                                                       (Intermediate and leaf nodes only; required) An array of two strings, specifying the (lexi-
                                                                                                    cally) least and greatest keys included in the Names array of a leaf node or in the Names
                                                                                                    arrays of any leaf nodes that are descendants of an intermediate node.
       The Kids entries in the root and intermediate nodes deﬁne the tree’s structure by
       identifying the immediate children of each node. The Names entries in the leaf
       (or root) nodes contain the tree’s keys and their associated values, arranged in
       key-value pairs and sorted lexically in ascending order by key. Shorter keys
       appear before longer ones beginning with the same byte sequence. The encoding
       of the keys is immaterial as long as it is self-consistent; keys are compared for
       equality on a simple byte-by-byte basis.
       The keys contained within the various nodes’ Names entries do not overlap; that
       is, each Names entry contains a single contiguous range of all the keys in the tree.
       In a leaf node, the Limits entry speciﬁes the least and greatest keys contained
       within the node’s Names entry; in an intermediate node, it speciﬁes the least and
       greatest keys contained within the Names entries of any of that node’s descen-
       dants. The value associated with a given key can thus be found by walking the tree
       in order, searching for the leaf node whose Names entry contains that key.

3.8.5 Number Trees
      A number tree is similar to a name tree (see Section 3.8.4, “Name Trees”), except
      that its keys are integers instead of strings, sorted in ascending numerical order.
      The entries in the leaf (or root) nodes containing the key-value pairs are named
      Nums instead of Names as in a name tree. Table 3.25 shows the entries in a num-
      ber tree’s node dictionaries.

     3.9 Functions
         PDF is not a programming language, and a PDF ﬁle is not a program; however,
         PDF does provide several types of function object (PDF 1.2) that represent param-
         eterized classes of functions, including mathematical formulas and sampled
         representations with arbitrary resolution. Functions are used in various ways in
         PDF: device-dependent rasterization information for high-quality printing (half-
         tone spot functions and transfer functions), color transform functions for certain
         color spaces, and speciﬁcation of colors as a function of position for smooth
         shadings.
         Functions in PDF represent static, self-contained numerical transformations. A
         function to add two numbers has two input values and one output value:
             f ( x0 , x1 ) = x0 + x1
         Similarly, a function that computes the arithmetic and geometric mean of two
         numbers could be viewed as a function of two input values and two output
         values:
                                 x0 + x1
             f ( x 0 , x 1 ) = ---------------- ,
                                              -   x0 × x1
                                      2
In general, a function can take any number (m) of input values and produce any
number (n) of output values:
    f ( x0 , … , xm – 1 ) = y0 , … , yn – 1
In PDF functions, all the input values and all the output values are numbers, and
functions have no side effects.
Each function deﬁnition includes a domain, the set of legal values for the input.
Some types of functions also deﬁne a range, the set of legal values for the output.
Input values passed to the function are clipped to the domain, and output values
produced by the function are clipped to the range. For example, suppose the
function
    f (x) = x + 2
is deﬁned with a domain of [−1 1]. If the function is called with the input value 6,
that value is replaced with the nearest value in the deﬁned domain, 1, before the
function is evaluated; the resulting output value is therefore 3. Similarly, if the
function
    f ( x0 , x1 ) = 3 × x0 + x1
is deﬁned with a range of [0 100], and if the input values −6 and 4 are passed to
the function (and are within its domain), then the output value produced by the
function, −14, is replaced with 0, the nearest value in the deﬁned range.
A function object may be a dictionary or a stream, depending on the type of
function; the term function dictionary will be used generically in this section to
refer to either a dictionary object or the dictionary portion of a stream object. A
function dictionary speciﬁes the function’s representation, the set of attributes
that parameterize that representation, and the additional data needed by that
representation. Four types of function are available, as indicated by the diction-
ary’s FunctionType entry:
• (PDF 1.2) A sampled function (type 0) uses a table of sample values to deﬁne the
   function. Various techniques are used to interpolate values between the sample
   values.
• (PDF 1.3) An exponential interpolation function (type 2) deﬁnes a set of coef-
   ﬁcients for an exponential function.
          • (PDF 1.3) A stitching function (type 3) is a combination of other functions, par-
             titioned across a domain.
          • (PDF 1.3) A PostScript calculator function (type 4) uses operators from the
             PostScript language to describe an arithmetic expression.
          All function dictionaries share the entries listed in Table 3.26.

          In addition, each type of function dictionary must include entries appropriate to
          the particular function type. The number of output values can usually be inferred
          from other attributes of the function; if not (as is always the case for type 0 and
          type 4 functions), the Range entry is required. The dimensionality of the func-
          tion implied by the Domain and Range entries must be consistent with that im-
          plied by other attributes of the function.
3.9.1 Type 0 (Sampled) Functions
      Type 0 functions use a sequence of sample values (contained in a stream) to pro-
      vide an approximation for functions whose domains and ranges are bounded.
      The samples are organized as an m-dimensional table in which each entry has n
      components.
      Sampled functions are highly general and offer reasonably accurate representa-
      tions of arbitrary analytic functions at low expense. For example, a 1-input sinus-
      oidal function can be represented over the range [0 180] with an average error of
      only 1 percent, using just ten samples and linear interpolation. Two-input func-
      tions require signiﬁcantly more samples, but usually not a prohibitive number, so
      long as the function does not have high frequency variations.
      The dimensionality of a sampled function is restricted only by implementation
      limits. However, the number of samples required to represent functions with
      high dimensionality multiplies rapidly unless the sampling resolution is very low.
      Also, the process of multilinear interpolation becomes computationally intensive
      if the number of inputs m is greater than 2. The multidimensional spline interpo-
      lation is even more computationally intensive.
      In addition to the entries in Table 3.26, a type 0 function dictionary includes
      those shown in Table 3.27.
      The Domain, Encode, and Size entries determine how the function’s input vari-
      able values are mapped into the sample table. For example, if Size is [21 31], the
      default Encode array is [0 20 0 30], which maps the entire domain into the full
      set of sample table entries. Other values of Encode may be used.
      To explain the relationship between Domain, Encode, Size, Decode, and Range,
      we use the following notation:
          y = Interpolate ( x , x min , x max , y min , y max )
                                         y max – y min 
            = y min +  ( x – x min ) × --------------------------- 
                                                                  -
                                         x max – x min 
      For a given value of x, Interpolate calculates the y value on the line deﬁned by the
      two points (xmin , ymin ) and (xmax , ymax ).

               e i ′ = min ( max ( e i , 0 ) , Size i – 1 )
            The encoded input values are real numbers, not restricted to integers. Interpola-
            tion is then used to determine output values from the nearest surrounding values
            in the sample table. Each output value rj , for 0 ≤ j < n, is then decoded:
               r j ′ = Interpolate ( r j , 0 , 2 BitsPerSample – 1 , Decode 2j , Decode 2j + 1 )
Finally, each decoded value is clipped to the range:
   y j = min ( max ( r j ′, Range 2j ) , Range 2j + 1 )
Sample data is represented as a stream of unsigned 8-bit bytes (integers in the
range 0 to 255). The bytes constitute a continuous bit stream, with the high-order
bit of each byte ﬁrst. Each sample value is represented as a sequence of
BitsPerSample bits. Successive values are adjacent in the bit stream; there is no
padding at byte boundaries.
For a function with multidimensional input (more than one input variable), the
sample values in the ﬁrst dimension vary fastest, and the values in the last dimen-
sion vary slowest. For example, for a function f(a, b, c), where a, b, and c vary
from 0 to 9 in steps of 1, the sample values would appear in this order: f(0, 0, 0),
f(1, 0, 0), …, f(9, 0, 0), f(0, 1, 0), f(1, 1, 0), …, f(9, 1, 0), f(0, 2, 0), f(1, 2, 0), …,
f(9, 9, 0), f(0, 0, 1), f(1, 0, 1), and so on.
For a function with multidimensional output (more than one output value), the
values are stored in the same order as Range.
The stream data must be long enough to contain the entire sample array, as indi-
cated by Size, Range, and BitsPerSample; see “Stream Extent” on page 37.
Example 3.13 illustrates a sampled function with 4-bit samples in an array
containing 21 columns and 31 rows (651 values). The function takes two argu-
ments, x and y, in the domain [−1.0 1.0], and returns one value, z, in that same
range. The x argument is linearly transformed by the encoding to the domain
[0 20] and the y argument to the domain [0 30]. Using bilinear interpolation be-
tween sample points, the function computes a value for z, which (because Bits-
PerSample is 4) will be in the range [0 15], and the decoding transforms z to a
number in the range [−1.0 1.0] for the result. The sample array is stored in a
string of 326 bytes, calculated as follows (rounded up):
   326 bytes = 31 rows × 21 samples/row × 4 bits/sample ÷ 8 bits/byte
The ﬁrst byte contains the sample for the point (−1.0, −1.0) in the high-order 4
bits and the sample for the point (−0.9, −1.0) in the low-order 4 bits.

                      endobj
                 The Decode entry can be used creatively to increase the accuracy of encoded
                 samples corresponding to certain values in the range. For example, if the desired
                 range of the function is [ −1.0 1.0] and BitsPerSample is 4, the usual value of
                 Decode would be [ −1.0 1.0] and the sample values would be integers in the inter-
                 val [0 15] (as shown in Figure 3.6). But if these values were used, the midpoint of
                 the range, 0.0, would not be represented exactly by any sample value, since it
                 would fall halfway between 7 and 8. On the other hand, if the Decode array were
                 [ −1.0 +1.1429] (1.1429 being approximately equal to 16 ÷ 14) and the sample
                 values supplied were in the interval [0 14], then the desired effective range of
                 [ −1.0 1.0] would be achieved, and the range value 0.0 would be represented by
                 the sample value 7.

         The Size value for an input dimension can be 1, in which case all input values in
         that dimension will be mapped to the single allowed value. If Size is less than 4,
         cubic spline interpolation is not possible and Order 3 will be ignored if speciﬁed.
  3.9.2 Type 2 (Exponential Interpolation) Functions
         Type 2 functions (PDF 1.3) include a set of parameters that deﬁne an exponential
         interpolation of one input value and n output values:
             f ( x ) = y0 , … , yn – 1
         In addition to the entries in Table 3.26 on page 108, a type 2 function dictionary
         includes those; listed in Table 3.28. (See implementation note 27 in Appendix H.)

                                                                                                    yj = C0j + xN × (C1j − C0j ), for 0 ≤ j < n.
         Values of Domain must constrain x in such a way that if N is not an integer, all
         values of x must be nonnegative, and if N is negative, no value of x may be zero.
         Typically, Domain will be declared as [0.0 1.0], and N will be a positive number.
         The Range attribute is optional and can be used to clip the output to a desired
         range. Note that when N is 1, the function performs a linear interpolation be-
         tween C0 and C1; this can also be expressed as a sampled function (type 0).
  3.9.3 Type 3 (Stitching) Functions
         Type 3 functions (PDF 1.3) deﬁne a “stitching” of the subdomains of several
         1-input functions to produce a single new 1-input function. Since the resulting
         stitching function is a 1-input function, the domain is given by a two-element
         array, [Domain0 Domain1 ].
          In addition to the entries in Table 3.26 on page 108, a type 3 function dictionary
          includes those listed in Table 3.29. (See implementation note 28 in Appendix H.)

                                                                                                    deﬁned by Domain.
Encode                                  array                                                       (Required) An array of 2 × k numbers that, taken in pairs, map each subset of the do-
                                                                                                    main deﬁned by Domain and the Bounds array to the domain of the corresponding
                                                                                                    function.
          Domain must be of size 2 (that is, m = 1), and Domain0 must be strictly less than
          Domain1 unless k = 1. The domain is partitioned into k subdomains, as indicated
          by the dictionary’s Bounds entry, which is an array of k − 1 numbers that obey
          the following relationships (with exceptions as noted below):
             Domain 0 < Bounds 0 < Bounds 1 < … < Bounds k – 2 < Domain 1
          The Bounds array describes a series of half-open intervals, closed on the left and
          open on the right (except the last, which is closed on the right as well). The value
          of the Functions entry is an array of k functions. The ﬁrst function applies to x
          values in the ﬁrst subdomain, Domain0 ≤ x < Bounds0 ; the second function ap-
          plies to x values in the second subdomain, Bounds0 ≤ x < Bounds1 ; and so on.
          The last function applies to x values in the last subdomain, which includes the
          upper bound: Boundsk−2 ≤ x ≤ Domain1 . The value of k may be 1, in which case
          the Bounds array is empty and the single item in the Functions array applies to all
          x values, Domain0 ≤ x ≤ Domain1 .
          The Encode array contains 2 × k numbers. A value x from the ith subdomain is
          encoded as follows:
             x′ = Interpolate ( x , Bounds i – 1 , Bounds i , Encode 2i , Encode 2i + 1 )
      for 0 ≤ i < k. In this equation, Bounds−1 means Domain0 , and Boundsk−1 means
      Domain1 . If the last bound, Boundsk−2 , is equal to Domain1 , then x′ is deﬁned to
      be Encode2i .
      The stitching function is designed to make it easy to combine several functions to
      be used within one shading pattern, over different parts of the shading’s domain.
      (Shading patterns are discussed in Section 4.6.3, “Shading Patterns.”) The same
      effect could be achieved by creating a separate shading dictionary for each of the
      functions, with adjacent domains. However, since each shading would have simi-
      lar parameters, and because the overall effect is one shading, it is more con-
      venient to have a single shading with multiple function deﬁnitions.
      Also, type 3 functions provide a general mechanism for inverting the domains of
      1-input functions. For example, consider a function f with a Domain of [0.0 1.0],
      and a stitching function g with a Domain of [0.0 1.0], a Functions array contain-
      ing f, and an Encode array of [1.0 0.0]. In effect, g(x) = f(1 − x).
3.9.4 Type 4 (PostScript Calculator) Functions
      A type 4 function (PDF 1.3), also called a PostScript calculator function, is repre-
      sented as a stream containing code written in a small subset of the PostScript lan-
      guage. While any function can be sampled (in a type 0 PDF function) and others
      can be described with exponential functions (type 2 in PDF), type 4 functions
      offer greater ﬂexibility and potentially greater accuracy. For example, a tint
      transformation function for a hexachrome (six-component) DeviceN color space
      with an alternate color space of DeviceCMYK (see “DeviceN Color Spaces” on
      page 205) requires a 6-in, 4-out function. If such a function were sampled with m
      values for each input variable, the number of samples, 4 × m6, could be prohibi-
      tively large. In practice, such functions are often written as short, simple Post-
      Script functions. (See implementation note 29 in Appendix H.)
      Type 4 functions also make it possible to include a wide variety of halftone spot
      functions without the loss of accuracy that comes from sampling, and without
      adding to the list of predeﬁned spot functions (see Section 6.4.2, “Spot Func-
      tions”). All of the predeﬁned spot functions can be written as type 4 functions.
      The language that can be used in a type 4 function contains expressions involving
      integers, real numbers, and boolean values only. There are no composite data
      structures such as strings or arrays, no procedures, and no variables or names.
      Table 3.30 lists the operators that can be used in this type of function. (For more
information on these operators, see Appendix B of the PostScript Language Refer-
ence, Third Edition.) Although the semantics are those of the corresponding
PostScript operators, a PostScript interpreter is not required.

The operand syntax for type 4 functions follows PDF conventions rather than
PostScript conventions. The entire code stream deﬁning the function is enclosed
in braces { }. Braces also delimit expressions that are executed conditionally by the
if and ifelse operators:
    boolean {expression} if
    boolean {expression1 } {expression2 } ifelse
Note that this is a purely syntactic construct; unlike in PostScript, no “procedure
objects” are involved.

A type 4 function dictionary includes the entries in Table 3.26 on page 108, as
well as other stream attributes as appropriate (see Table 3.4 on page 38). Example
3.14 shows a type 4 function equivalent to the predeﬁned spot function Double-
Dot (see Section 6.4.2, “Spot Functions”).
Example 3.14
   10 0 obj
       << /FunctionType 4
           /Domain [−1.0 1.0 −1.0 1.0]
           /Range [−1.0 1.0]
           /Length 71
       >>
   stream
       { 360 mul sin
         2 div
         exch 360 mul sin
         2 div
         add
       }
   endstream
   endobj
The Domain and Range entries are both required. The input variables constitute
the initial operand stack; the items remaining on the operand stack after execu-
tion of the function are the output variables. It is an error for the number of re-
maining operands to differ from the number of output variables speciﬁed by
Range, or for any of them to be objects other than numbers.
Implementations of type 4 functions must provide a stack with room for at least
100 entries. No implementation is required to provide a larger stack, and it is an
error to overﬂow the stack.
Although any integers or real numbers that may appear in the stream fall under
the same implementation limits (deﬁned in Appendix C) as in other contexts, the
intermediate results in type 4 function computations do not. An implementation
may use a representation that exceeds those limits. Operations on real numbers,
for example, might use single-precision or double-precision ﬂoating-point num-
bers. (See implementation note 30 in Appendix H.)
Errors in Type 4 Functions
The code that reads a type 4 function (analogous to the PostScript scanner) must
detect and report syntax errors. It may also be able to detect some errors that will
occur when the function is used, although this is not always possible. Any errors
       detected by the scanner are considered to be errors in the PDF ﬁle itself and are
       handled like other errors in the ﬁle.
       The code that executes a type 4 function (analogous to the PostScript interpreter)
       must detect and report errors. PDF does not deﬁne a representation for the
       errors; those details are provided by the application that processes the PDF ﬁle.
       The following types of errors can occur (among others):
       • Stack overﬂow
       • Stack underﬂow
       • A type error (for example, applying not to a real number)
       • A range error (for example, applying sqrt to a negative number)
       • An undeﬁned result (for example, dividing by 0)
 3.10 File Speciﬁcations
       A PDF ﬁle can refer to the contents of another ﬁle by using a ﬁle speciﬁcation
       (PDF 1.1), which can take either of two forms. A simple ﬁle speciﬁcation gives just
       the name of the target ﬁle in a standard format, independent of the naming con-
       ventions of any particular ﬁle system; a full ﬁle speciﬁcation includes information
       related to one or more speciﬁc ﬁle systems. A simple ﬁle speciﬁcation may take
       the form of either a string or a dictionary; a full ﬁle speciﬁcation can only be rep-
       resented as a dictionary.
       Although the ﬁle designated by a ﬁle speciﬁcation is normally external to the PDF
       ﬁle referring to it, PDF 1.3 permits a copy of the external ﬁle to be embedded
       within the PDF ﬁle itself, allowing its contents to be stored or transmitted along
       with the PDF ﬁle. However, embedding a ﬁle does not change the presumption
       that it is external to the PDF ﬁle. Consequently, in order for the PDF ﬁle to be
       processed correctly, it may be necessary to copy the embedded ﬁles it contains
       back into a local ﬁle system.
3.10.1 File Speciﬁcation Strings
       The standard format for representing a simple ﬁle speciﬁcation in string form
       divides the string into component substrings separated by the slash character (/).
       The slash is a generic component separator that is mapped to the appropriate
platform-speciﬁc separator when generating a platform-dependent ﬁle name.
Any of the components may be empty. If a component contains one or more lit-
eral slashes, each must be preceded by a backslash (\), which in turn must be pre-
ceded by another backslash to indicate that it is part of the string and not an
escape character. For example, the string
   (in\\/out)
represents the ﬁle name
   in/out
The backslashes are removed in processing the string; they are needed only to dis-
tinguish the component values from the component separators. The component
substrings are stored as bytes and are passed to the operating system without in-
terpretation or conversion of any sort.
Absolute and Relative File Speciﬁcations
A simple ﬁle speciﬁcation that begins with a slash is an absolute ﬁle speciﬁcation.
The last component is the ﬁle name; the preceding components specify its con-
text. In some ﬁle speciﬁcations, the ﬁle name may be empty; for example, URL
(uniform resource locator) speciﬁcations can specify directories instead of ﬁles. A
ﬁle speciﬁcation that does not begin with a slash is a relative ﬁle speciﬁcation giv-
ing the location of the ﬁle relative to that of the PDF ﬁle containing it.
In the case of a URL-based ﬁle system, the rules of Internet RFC 1808, Relative
Uniform Resource Locators (see the Bibliography), are used to compute an abso-
lute URL from a relative ﬁle speciﬁcation and the speciﬁcation of the PDF ﬁle.
Prior to this process, the relative ﬁle speciﬁcation is converted to a relative URL
by using the escape mechanism of RFC 1738, Uniform Resource Locators, to rep-
resent any bytes that would be either “unsafe” according to RFC 1738 or not
representable in 7-bit U.S. ASCII. In addition, such URL-based relative ﬁle speci-
ﬁcations are limited to paths as deﬁned in RFC 1808; the scheme, network loca-
tion/login, fragment identiﬁer, query information, and parameter sections are
not allowed.
In the case of other ﬁle systems, a relative ﬁle speciﬁcation is converted to an ab-
solute ﬁle speciﬁcation by removing the ﬁle name component from the speciﬁca-
tion of the containing PDF ﬁle and appending the relative ﬁle speciﬁcation in its
place. For example, the relative ﬁle speciﬁcation
    ArtFiles/Figure1.pdf
appearing in a PDF ﬁle whose speciﬁcation is
    /HardDisk/PDFDocuments/AnnualReport/Summary.pdf
yields the absolute speciﬁcation
    /HardDisk/PDFDocuments/AnnualReport/ArtFiles/Figure1.pdf
The special component .. (two periods) can be used in a relative ﬁle speciﬁcation
to move up a level in the ﬁle system hierarchy. When the component immediately
preceding .. is not another .. , the two cancel each other; both are eliminated from
the ﬁle speciﬁcation and the process is repeated. Thus in the example above, the
relative ﬁle speciﬁcation
    ../../ArtFiles/Figure1.pdf
would yield the absolute speciﬁcation
    /HardDisk/ArtFiles/Figure1.pdf
Conversion to Platform-Dependent File Names
The conversion of a ﬁle speciﬁcation into a platform-dependent ﬁle name de-
pends on the speciﬁc ﬁle naming conventions of each platform. For example:
• For DOS, the initial component is either a physical or logical drive identiﬁer or
   a network resource name as returned by the Microsoft Windows function
   WNetGetConnection, and is followed by a colon ( : ). A network resource name
   is constructed from the ﬁrst two components; the ﬁrst component is the server
   name and the second is the share name (volume name). All components are
   then separated by backslashes. It is possible to specify an absolute DOS path
   without a drive by making the ﬁrst component empty. (Empty components are
   ignored by other platforms.)
• For Mac OS, all components are separated by colons ( : ).
• For UNIX, all components are separated by slashes ( / ). An initial slash, if
  present, is preserved.
Strings used to specify a ﬁle name are interpreted in the standard encoding for
the platform on which the document is being viewed. Table 3.31 shows examples
of ﬁle speciﬁcations on the most common platforms.
                       TABLE 3.31 Examples of ﬁle speciﬁcations

                 pclib/eng:\pdfdocs\spec.pdf        (/pclib/eng/pdfdocs/spec.pdf)
Mac OS           Mac HD:PDFDocs:spec.pdf            (/Mac HD/PDFDocs/spec.pdf)
UNIX             /user/fred/pdfdocs/spec.pdf        (/user/fred/pdfdocs/spec.pdf)
                 pdfdocs/spec.pdf (relative)        (pdfdocs/spec.pdf)
When creating documents that are to be viewed on multiple platforms, care must
be taken to ensure ﬁle name compatibility. Only a subset of the U.S. ASCII char-
acter set should be used in ﬁle speciﬁcations: the uppercase alphabetic characters
(A–Z), the numeric characters (0–9), and the underscore ( _ ). The period ( . ) has
special meaning in DOS and Windows ﬁle names, and as the ﬁrst character in a
Mac OS pathname. In ﬁle speciﬁcations, the period should be used only to sepa-
rate a base ﬁle name from a ﬁle extension.
Some ﬁle systems are case-insensitive, so names within a directory should re-
main distinguishable if lowercase letters are changed to uppercase or vice versa.
On DOS and Windows 3.1 systems and on some CD-ROM ﬁle systems, ﬁle
names are limited to 8 characters plus a 3-character extension. File system soft-
ware typically converts long names to short names by retaining the ﬁrst 6 or 7
characters of the ﬁle name and the ﬁrst 3 characters after the last period, if any.
Since characters beyond the sixth or seventh are often converted to other values
unrelated to the original value, ﬁle names must be distinguishable from the ﬁrst
6 characters.
        Multiple-Byte Strings in File Speciﬁcations
        In PDF 1.2 or higher, a ﬁle speciﬁcation may contain multiple-byte character
        codes, represented in hexadecimal form between angle brackets (< and >). Since
        the slash character <2F> is used as a component delimiter and the backslash
        <5C> is used as an escape character, any occurrence of either of these bytes in a
        multiple-byte character must be preceded by the ASCII code for the backslash
        character. For example, a ﬁle name containing the 2-byte character code
        <89 5C> must write it as <89 5C 5C>. When the viewer application encounters
        this sequence of bytes in a ﬁle name, it replaces the sequence with the original
        2-byte code.
 3.10.2 File Speciﬁcation Dictionaries
        The dictionary form of ﬁle speciﬁcation provides more ﬂexibility than the string
        form, allowing different ﬁles to be speciﬁed for different ﬁle systems or platforms,
        or for ﬁle systems other than the standard ones (DOS/Windows, Mac OS, and
        UNIX). Table 3.32 shows the entries in a ﬁle speciﬁcation dictionary. Viewer ap-
        plications running on a particular platform should use the appropriate platform-
        speciﬁc entry (DOS, Mac, or Unix) if available. If the required platform-speciﬁc
        entry is not present and there is no ﬁle system entry (FS), the generic F entry
        should be used as a simple ﬁle speciﬁcation.

 3.10.3 Embedded File Streams
        File speciﬁcations ordinarily refer to ﬁles external to the PDF ﬁle in which they
        occur. To preserve the integrity of the PDF ﬁle, this requires that all external ﬁles
        it refers to must accompany it when it is archived or transmitted. Embedded ﬁle
        streams (PDF 1.3) address this problem by allowing the contents of the referenced
        ﬁles to be embedded directly within the body of the PDF ﬁle itself. For example, if
        the ﬁle contains OPI (Open Prepress Interface) dictionaries that refer to external-
        ly stored high-resolution images (see Section 9.10.6, “Open Prepress Interface
        (OPI)”), the image data can be incorporated into the PDF ﬁle with embedded ﬁle
        streams. This makes the PDF ﬁle a self-contained unit that can be stored or trans-
        mitted as a single entity. (The embedded ﬁles are included purely for conve-
        nience, and need not be directly processed by any PDF consumer application.)
        One way of including an embedded ﬁle stream in a PDF document is through the
        EF entry in the ﬁle speciﬁcation dictionary. This method still requires a ﬁle speci-
        ﬁcation to be provided, associating a location in the ﬁle system with the stream
        data. It is also possible to embed data in a PDF document independently of any
        ﬁle system: the data’s presence in the document is all that is required. This can be
        done using an embedded ﬁle stream referenced by a private entry in a dictionary.
        However, PDF 1.4 deﬁnes a standard location for the data: the EmbeddedFiles
        entry in the PDF document’s name dictionary can contain a name tree that maps
        name strings to embedded ﬁle streams (see Section 3.6.3, “Name Dictionary”).
        Note: The relationship between the name string provided in the name dictionary
        and the associated embedded ﬁle stream is an artiﬁcial one for data management
        purposes. This allows embedded ﬁles to be easily identiﬁed by the author of the docu-
        ment, in much the same way that the JavaScript name tree associates name strings
        with document-level JavaScript actions (see “JavaScript Actions” on page 556).
        The stream dictionary describing an embedded ﬁle contains the standard entries
        for any stream, such as Length and Filter (see Table 3.4 on page 38), as well as the
        additional entries shown in Table 3.33.

          For Mac OS ﬁles, the Mac entry in the embedded ﬁle parameter dictionary holds
          a further subdictionary containing Mac OS–speciﬁc ﬁle information. Table 3.35

          Related Files Arrays
          In some circumstances, a PDF ﬁle can refer to a group of related ﬁles, such as the
          set of ﬁve ﬁles that make up a DCS 1.0 color-separated image. The ﬁle speciﬁca-
          tion explicitly names only one of the ﬁles; the rest are identiﬁed by some system-
          atic variation of that ﬁle name (such as by altering the extension). When such a
          ﬁle is to be embedded in a PDF ﬁle, the related ﬁles must be embedded as well.
          This is accomplished by including a related ﬁles array (PDF 1.3) as the value of the
RF entry in the ﬁle speciﬁcation dictionary. The array has 2 × n elements, which
are paired in the form
   [ string1 stream1
     string2 stream2
     …
     stringn streamn
   ]
The ﬁrst element of each pair is a string giving the name of one of the related ﬁles;
the second element is an embedded ﬁle stream holding the ﬁle’s contents.
In Example 3.15, objects 21, 31, and 41 are embedded ﬁle streams containing the
DOS ﬁle SUNSET.EPS, the Mac OS ﬁle Sunset.eps, and the UNIX ﬁle Sunset.eps,
respectively. The ﬁle speciﬁcation dictionary’s RF entry speciﬁes an array, object
30, identifying a set of embedded ﬁles related to the Mac OS ﬁle, forming a
DCS 1.0 set. The example shows only the ﬁrst two embedded ﬁle streams in the
set; an actual PDF ﬁle would of course include all of them.

          endstream
          endobj
3.10.4 URL Speciﬁcations
       When the FS entry in a ﬁle speciﬁcation dictionary has the value URL, the value of
       the F entry in that dictionary is not a ﬁle speciﬁcation string, but a uniform
       resource locator (URL) of the form deﬁned in Internet RFC 1738, Uniform
       Resource Locators (see the Bibliography). Example 3.16 shows a URL speciﬁca-
       tion.
       Example 3.16
          << /FS /URL
              /F (ftp://www.beatles.com/Movies/AbbeyRoad.mov)
          >>
       The URL must adhere to the character-encoding requirements speciﬁed in RFC
       1738. Because 7-bit U.S. ASCII is a strict subset of PDFDocEncoding, this value
       may also be considered to be in that encoding.
3.10.5 Maintenance of File Speciﬁcations
       The techniques described in this section can be used to maintain the integrity of
       the ﬁle speciﬁcations within a PDF ﬁle during operations such as the following:
       • Updating the relevant ﬁle speciﬁcation when a referenced ﬁle is renamed
       • Determining the complete collection of ﬁles that must be copied to a mirror
          site
       • When creating new links to external ﬁles, discovering existing ﬁle speciﬁcations
          that refer to the same ﬁles and sharing them
       • Finding the ﬁle speciﬁcations associated with embedded ﬁles to be packed or
          unpacked
       It is not possible, in general, to ﬁnd all ﬁle speciﬁcation strings in a PDF ﬁle, be-
       cause there is no way to determine whether a given string is a ﬁle speciﬁcation
       string. It is possible, however, to ﬁnd all ﬁle speciﬁcation dictionaries, provided
       that they meet the following conditions:
       • They are indirect objects.
       • They contain a Type entry whose value is the name Filespec.
       An application can then locate all of the ﬁle speciﬁcation dictionaries by travers-
       ing the PDF ﬁle’s cross-reference table (see Section 3.4.3, “Cross-Reference
       Table”) and ﬁnding all dictionaries with Type keys whose value is Filespec. For
       this reason, it is highly recommended that all ﬁle speciﬁcations be expressed in
       dictionary form and meet the conditions stated above. Note that any ﬁle speciﬁ-
       cation dictionary specifying embedded ﬁles (that is, one that contains an EF en-
       try) must satisfy these conditions (see Table 3.32 on page 122).
       Note: It may not be possible to locate ﬁle speciﬁcation dictionaries that are direct ob-
       jects, since they are neither self-typed nor necessarily reachable via any standard
       path of object references.
       Files may be embedded in a PDF ﬁle either directly, using the EF entry in a ﬁle
       speciﬁcation dictionary, or indirectly, using related ﬁles arrays speciﬁed in the RF
       entry. If a ﬁle is embedded indirectly, its name is given by the string that precedes
       the embedded ﬁle stream in the related ﬁles array; if it is embedded directly, its
       name is obtained from the value of the corresponding entry in the ﬁle speciﬁca-
tion dictionary. In Example 3.15 on page 126, for instance, the EF dictionary has a
DOS entry identifying object number 21 as an embedded ﬁle stream; the name of
the embedded DOS ﬁle, SUNSET.EPS, is given by the DOS entry in the ﬁle
speciﬁcation dictionary.
A given external ﬁle may be referenced from more than one ﬁle speciﬁcation.
Therefore, when embedding a ﬁle with a given name, it is necessary to check for
other occurrences of the same name as the value associated with the correspond-
ing key in other ﬁle speciﬁcation dictionaries. This requires ﬁnding all embed-
dable ﬁle speciﬁcations and, for each matching key, checking for both of the
following conditions:
• The string value associated with the key matches the name of the ﬁle being em-
   bedded.
• A value has not already been embedded for the ﬁle speciﬁcation. (If there is
   already a corresponding key in the EF dictionary, then a ﬁle has already been
   embedded for that use of the ﬁle name.)
Note that there is no requirement that the ﬁles associated with a given ﬁle name
be unique. The same ﬁle name, such as readme.txt, may be associated with differ-
ent embedded ﬁles in distinct ﬁle speciﬁcations.
                                  CHAPTER 4
                                4Graphics
THE GRAPHICS OPERATORS used in PDF content streams describe the ap-
pearance of pages that are to be reproduced on a raster output device. The
facilities described in this chapter are intended for both printer and display appli-
cations.
The graphics operators form six main groups:
• Graphics state operators manipulate the data structure called the graphics state,
  the global framework within which the other graphics operators execute. The
  graphics state includes the current transformation matrix (CTM), which maps
  user space coordinates used within a PDF content stream into output device
  coordinates. It also includes the current color, the current clipping path, and
  many other parameters that are implicit operands of the painting operators.
• Path construction operators specify paths, which deﬁne shapes, line trajectories,
  and regions of various sorts. They include operators for beginning a new path,
  adding line segments and curves to it, and closing it.
• Path-painting operators ﬁll a path with a color, paint a stroke along it, or use it
  as a clipping boundary.
• Other painting operators paint certain self-describing graphics objects. These
  include sampled images, geometrically deﬁned shadings, and entire content
  streams that in turn contain sequences of graphics operators.
• Text operators select and show character glyphs from fonts (descriptions of type-
  faces for representing text characters). Because PDF treats glyphs as general
  graphical shapes, many of the text operators could be grouped with the graph-
  ics state or painting operators. However, the data structures and mechanisms
  for dealing with glyph and font descriptions are sufﬁciently specialized that
  Chapter 5 focuses on them.
                                           131
    • Marked-content operators associate higher-level logical information with ob-
       jects in the content stream. This information does not affect the rendered ap-
       pearance of the content; it is useful to applications that use PDF for document
       interchange. Marked content is described in Section 9.5, “Marked Content.”
    This chapter presents general information about device-independent graphics in
    PDF: how a PDF content stream describes the abstract appearance of a page.
    Rendering—the device-dependent part of graphics—is covered in Chapter 6. The
    Bibliography lists a number of books that give details of these computer graphics
    concepts and their implementation.
4.1 Graphics Objects
    As discussed in Section 3.7.1, “Content Streams,” the data in a content stream is
    interpreted as a sequence of operators and their operands, expressed as basic data
    objects according to standard PDF syntax. A content stream can describe the
    appearance of a page, or it can be treated as a graphical element in certain other
    contexts.
    The operands and operators are written sequentially using postﬁx notation.
    Although this notation resembles the sequential execution model of the Post-
    Script language, a PDF content stream is not a program to be interpreted; rather,
    it is a static description of a sequence of graphics objects. There are speciﬁc rules,
    described below, for writing the operands and operators that describe a graphics
    object.
    PDF provides ﬁve types of graphics object:
    • A path object is an arbitrary shape made up of straight lines, rectangles, and
       cubic Bézier curves. A path may intersect itself and may have disconnected
       sections and holes. A path object ends with one or more painting operators
       that specify whether the path is stroked, ﬁlled, used as a clipping boundary, or
       some combination of these operations.
    • A text object consists of one or more character strings that identify sequences of
       glyphs to be painted. Like a path, text can be stroked, ﬁlled, or used as a clip-
       ping boundary.
    • An external object (XObject) is an object deﬁned outside the content stream and
       referenced as a named resource (see Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries”).
       The interpretation of an XObject depends on its type. An image XObject deﬁnes
   a rectangular array of color samples to be painted; a form XObject is an entire
   content stream to be treated as a single graphics object. Specialized types of
   form XObject are used to import content from one PDF ﬁle into another
   (reference XObjects) and to group graphical elements together as a unit for
   various purposes (group XObjects). In particular, the latter are used to deﬁne
   transparency groups for use in the transparent imaging model (transparency
   group XObjects, discussed in detail in Chapter 7). There is also a PostScript
   XObject, whose use is discouraged.
• An inline image object is a means of expressing the data for a small image di-
   rectly within the content stream, using a special syntax.
• A shading object describes a geometric shape whose color is an arbitrary func-
   tion of position within the shape. (A shading can also be treated as a color
   when painting other graphics objects; it is not considered to be a separate
   graphics object in that case.)
PDF 1.3 and earlier versions use an opaque imaging model in which each graphics
object is painted in sequence, completely obscuring any previous marks it may
overlay on the page. PDF 1.4 introduces a new transparent imaging model in
which objects can be less than fully opaque, allowing previously painted marks to
show through. Each object is painted on the page with a speciﬁed opacity, which
may be constant at every point within the object’s shape or may vary from point
to point. The previously existing contents of the page form a backdrop with which
the new object is composited, producing results that combine the colors of the
object and backdrop according to their respective opacity characteristics. The ob-
jects at any given point on the page can be thought of as forming a transparency
stack, where the stacking order is deﬁned to be the order in which the objects are
speciﬁed, bottommost object ﬁrst. All objects in the stack can potentially contrib-
ute to the result, depending on their colors, shapes, and opacities.
PDF’s graphics parameters are so arranged that objects are painted by default
with full opacity, reducing the behavior of the transparent imaging model to that
of the opaque model. Accordingly, the material in this chapter applies to both the
opaque and transparent models except where explicitly stated otherwise; the
transparent model is described in its full generality in Chapter 7.
Although the painting behavior described above is often attributed to individual
operators making up an object, it is always the object as a whole that is painted.
Figure 4.1 shows the ordering rules for the operations that deﬁne graphics
objects. Some operations are permitted only in certain types of graphics object or
in the intervals between graphics objects (called the page description level in the
ﬁgure). Every content stream begins at the page description level, where changes
can be made to the graphics state, such as colors and text attributes, as discussed
in the following sections.
In the ﬁgure, arrows indicate the operators that mark the beginning or end of
each type of graphics object. Some operators are identiﬁed individually, others by
general category. Table 4.1 summarizes these categories for all PDF operators. For
example, the path construction operators m and re signal the beginning of a path
object. Inside the path object, additional path construction operators are permit-
ted, as are the clipping path operators W and W*, but not general graphics state
operators such as w or J. A path-painting operator, such as S or f, ends the path
object and returns to the page description level.

    Note: A content stream whose operations violate these rules for describing graphics
    objects can produce unpredictable behavior, even though it may display and print
    correctly. Applications that attempt to extract graphics objects for editing or other
    purposes depend on the objects’ being well formed. The rules for graphics objects are
    also important for the proper interpretation of marked content (see Section 9.5,
    “Marked Content”).
    A graphics object also implicitly includes all graphics state parameters that affect
    its behavior. For instance, a path object depends on the value of the current color
    parameter at the moment the path object is deﬁned. The effect is as if this param-
    eter were speciﬁed as part of the deﬁnition of the path object. However, the oper-
    ators that are invoked at the page description level to set graphics state
    parameters are not considered to belong to any particular graphics object. Graph-
    ics state parameters need to be speciﬁed only when they change. A graphics
    object may depend on parameters that were deﬁned much earlier.
    Similarly, the individual character strings within a text object implicitly include
    the graphics state parameters on which they depend. Most of these parameters
    may be set either inside or outside the text object. The effect is as if they were sep-
    arately speciﬁed for each text string.
    The important point is that there is no semantic signiﬁcance to the exact arrange-
    ment of graphics state operators. An application that reads and writes a PDF con-
    tent stream is not required to preserve this arrangement, but is free to change it to
    any other arrangement that achieves the same values of the relevant graphics
    state parameters for each graphics object. An application should not infer any
    higher-level logical semantics from the arrangement of tokens constituting a
    graphics object. A separate mechanism, marked content (see Section 9.5, “Marked
    Content”), allows such higher-level information to be explicitly associated with
    the graphics objects.
4.2 Coordinate Systems
    Coordinate systems deﬁne the canvas on which all painting occurs. They deter-
    mine the position, orientation, and size of the text, graphics, and images that
    appear on a page. This section describes each of the coordinate systems used in
    PDF, how they are related, and how transformations among them are speciﬁed.
4.2.1 Coordinate Spaces
      Paths and positions are deﬁned in terms of pairs of coordinates on the Cartesian
      plane. A coordinate pair is a pair of real numbers x and y that locate a point
      horizontally and vertically within a two-dimensional coordinate space. A coordi-
      nate space is determined by the following properties with respect to the current
      page:
      • The location of the origin
      • The orientation of the x and y axes
      • The lengths of the units along each axis
      PDF deﬁnes several coordinate spaces in which the coordinates specifying graph-
      ics objects are interpreted. The following sections describe these spaces and the
      relationships among them.
      Transformations among coordinate spaces are deﬁned by transformation matrices,
      which can specify any linear mapping of two-dimensional coordinates, including
      translation, scaling, rotation, reﬂection, and skewing. Transformation matrices
      are discussed in Sections 4.2.2, “Common Transformations,” and 4.2.3, “Trans-
      formation Matrices.”
      Device Space
      The contents of a page ultimately appear on a raster output device such as a dis-
      play or a printer. Such devices vary greatly in the built-in coordinate systems they
      use to address pixels within their imageable areas. A particular device’s coordi-
      nate system is called its device space. The origin of the device space on different
      devices can fall in different places on the output page; on displays, the origin can
      vary depending on the window system. Because the paper or other output me-
      dium moves through different printers and imagesetters in different directions,
      the axes of their device spaces may be oriented differently; for instance, vertical
      (y) coordinates may increase from the top of the page to the bottom on some
      devices and from bottom to top on others. Finally, different devices have different
      resolutions; some even have resolutions that differ in the horizontal and vertical
      directions.
If coordinates in a PDF ﬁle were speciﬁed in device space, the ﬁle would be
device-dependent and would appear differently on different devices. For exam-
ple, images speciﬁed in the typical device spaces of a 72-pixel-per-inch display
and a 600-dot-per-inch printer would differ in size by more than a factor of 8; an
8-inch line segment on the display would appear less than 1 inch long on the
printer. Figure 4.2 shows how the same graphics object, speciﬁed in device space,
can appear drastically different when rendered on different output devices.

User Space
To avoid the device-dependent effects of specifying objects in device space, PDF
deﬁnes a device-independent coordinate system that always bears the same rela-
tionship to the current page, regardless of the output device on which printing or
displaying will occur. This device-independent coordinate system is called user
space.
The user space coordinate system is initialized to a default state for each page of a
document. The CropBox entry in the page dictionary speciﬁes the rectangle of
user space corresponding to the visible area of the intended output medium (dis-
play window or printed page). The positive x axis extends horizontally to the
right and the positive y axis vertically upward, as in standard mathematical prac-
tice (subject to alteration by the Rotate entry in the page dictionary). The length
of a unit along both the x and y axes is 1⁄72 inch. This coordinate system is called
default user space.
Note: In PostScript, the origin of default user space always corresponds to the lower-
left corner of the output medium. While this convention is common in PDF docu-
ments as well, it is not required; the page dictionary’s CropBox entry can specify any
rectangle of default user space to be made visible on the medium.
Note: The unit size in default user space (1⁄72 inch) is approximately the same as a
point, a unit widely used in the printing industry. It is not exactly the same, how-
ever; there is no universal deﬁnition of a point.
Conceptually, user space is an inﬁnite plane. Only a small portion of this plane
corresponds to the imageable area of the output device: a rectangular region de-
ﬁned by the CropBox entry in the page dictionary. The region of default user
space that is viewed or printed can be different for each page, and is described in
Section 9.10.1, “Page Boundaries.”
Note: Because coordinates in user space (as in any other coordinate space) may be
speciﬁed as either integers or real numbers, the unit size in default user space does
not constrain positions to any arbitrary grid. The resolution of coordinates in user
space is not related in any way to the resolution of pixels in device space.
The transformation from user space to device space is deﬁned by the current
transformation matrix (CTM), an element of the PDF graphics state (see Sec-
tion 4.3, “Graphics State”). A PDF viewer application can adjust the CTM for
the native resolution of a particular output device, maintaining the device-
independence of the PDF page description itself. Figure 4.3 shows how this
allows an object speciﬁed in user space to appear the same regardless of the de-
vice on which it is rendered.
The default user space provides a consistent, dependable starting place for PDF
page descriptions regardless of the output device used. If necessary, a PDF con-
tent stream may then modify user space to be more suitable to its needs by apply-
ing the coordinate transformation operator, cm (see Section 4.3.3, “Graphics State
Operators”). Thus what may appear to be absolute coordinates in a content
stream are not absolute with respect to the current page, because they are
expressed in a coordinate system that may slide around and shrink or expand.
Coordinate system transformation not only enhances device-independence but is
a useful tool in its own right. For example, a content stream originally composed
to occupy an entire page can be incorporated without change as an element of
another page by shrinking the coordinate system in which it is drawn.

                                 FIGURE 4.3 User space
Other Coordinate Spaces
In addition to device space and user space, PDF uses a variety of other coordinate
spaces for specialized purposes:
• The coordinates of text are speciﬁed in text space. The transformation from text
  space to user space is deﬁned by a text matrix in combination with several text-
  related parameters in the graphics state (see Section 5.3.1, “Text-Positioning
  Operators”).
• Character glyphs in a font are deﬁned in glyph space (see Section 5.1.3, “Glyph
  Positioning and Metrics”). The transformation from glyph space to text space
  is deﬁned by the font matrix. For most types of font, this matrix is predeﬁned
  to map 1000 units of glyph space to 1 unit of text space; for Type 3 fonts, the
  font matrix is given explicitly in the font dictionary (see Section 5.5.4, “Type 3
  Fonts”).
      • All sampled images are deﬁned in image space. The transformation from image
        space to user space is predeﬁned and cannot be changed. All images are 1 unit
        wide by 1 unit high in user space, regardless of the number of samples in the
        image. To be painted, an image must be mapped to the desired region of the
        page by temporarily altering the current transformation matrix (CTM).
        Note: In PostScript, unlike PDF, the relationship between image space and user
        space can be speciﬁed explicitly. The ﬁxed transformation prescribed in PDF corre-
        sponds to the convention that is recommended for use in PostScript.
      • A form XObject (discussed in Section 4.9, “Form XObjects”) is a self-contained
        content stream that can be treated as a graphical element within another con-
        tent stream. The space in which it is deﬁned is called form space. The transfor-
        mation from form space to user space is speciﬁed by a form matrix contained in
        the form XObject.
      • PDF 1.2 deﬁnes a type of color known as a pattern, discussed in Section 4.6,
        “Patterns.” A pattern is deﬁned either by a content stream that is invoked
        repeatedly to tile an area or by a shading whose color is a function of position.
        The space in which a pattern is deﬁned is called pattern space. The transforma-
        tion from pattern space to user space is speciﬁed by a pattern matrix contained
        in the pattern.
      Relationships among Coordinate Spaces
      Figure 4.4 shows the relationships among the coordinate spaces described above.
      Each arrow in the ﬁgure represents a transformation from one coordinate space
      to another. PDF allows modiﬁcations to many of these transformations.
      Because PDF coordinate spaces are deﬁned relative to one another, changes made
      to one transformation can affect the appearance of objects deﬁned in several
      coordinate spaces. For example, a change in the CTM, which deﬁnes the trans-
      formation from user space to device space, will affect forms, text, images, and
      patterns, since they are all “upstream” from user space.
4.2.2 Common Transformations
      A transformation matrix speciﬁes the relationship between two coordinate spaces.
      By modifying a transformation matrix, objects can be scaled, rotated, translated,
      or transformed in other ways.

                   FIGURE 4.4 Relationships among coordinate systems
A transformation matrix in PDF is speciﬁed by six numbers, usually in the form
of an array containing six elements. In its most general form, this array is denoted
[a b c d e f]; it can represent any linear transformation from one coordinate
system to another. This section lists the arrays that specify the most common
transformations; Section 4.2.3, “Transformation Matrices,” discusses more math-
ematical details of transformations, including information on specifying trans-
formations that are combinations of those listed here.
• Translations are speciﬁed as [1     0 0 1 tx ty ], where tx and ty are the distances to
  translate the origin of the coordinate system in the horizontal and vertical
  dimensions, respectively.
• Scaling is obtained by   [sx 0 0 sy 0 0]. This scales the coordinates so that 1
  unit in the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the new coordinate system is
  the same size as sx and sy units, respectively, in the previous coordinate system.
• Rotations are produced by [ cos θ sin θ −sin θ cos θ        0 0], which has the effect
  of rotating the coordinate system axes by an angle θ counterclockwise.
• Skew is speciﬁed by [1 tan α tan β      1 0 0], which skews the x axis by an angle
  α and the y axis by an angle β.
      Figure 4.5 shows examples of each transformation. The directions of translation,
      rotation, and skew shown in the ﬁgure correspond to positive values of the array
      elements.

      If several transformations are combined, the order in which they are applied is
      signiﬁcant. For example, ﬁrst scaling and then translating the x axis is not the
      same as ﬁrst translating and then scaling it. In general, to obtain the expected
      results, transformations should be done in the following order:
      1. Translate
      2. Rotate
      3. Scale or skew
      Figure 4.6 shows the effect of the order in which transformations are applied. The
      ﬁgure shows two sequences of transformations applied to a coordinate system.
      After each successive transformation, an outline of the letter n is drawn.

        The transformations shown in the ﬁgure are as follows:
       • A translation of 10 units in the x direction and 20 units in the y direction
       • A rotation of 30 degrees
       • A scaling by a factor of 3 in the x direction
       In the ﬁgure, the axes are shown with a dash pattern having a 2-unit dash and a
       2-unit gap. In addition, the original (untransformed) axes are shown in a lighter
       color for reference. Notice that the scale-rotate-translate ordering results in a
       distortion of the coordinate system, leaving the x and y axes no longer perpendic-
       ular, while the recommended translate-rotate-scale ordering does not.
4.2.3 Transformation Matrices
       This section discusses the mathematics of transformation matrices. It is not
       necessary to read this section in order to use the transformations described previ-
ously; the information is presented for the beneﬁt of readers who want to gain a
deeper understanding of the theoretical basis of coordinate transformations.
To understand the mathematics of coordinate transformations in PDF, it is vital
to remember two points:
• Transformations alter coordinate systems, not graphics objects. All objects painted
   before a transformation is applied are unaffected by the transformation. Ob-
   jects painted after the transformation is applied will be interpreted in the trans-
   formed coordinate system.
• Transformation matrices specify the transformation from the new (transformed)
   coordinate system to the original (untransformed) coordinate system. All coor-
   dinates used after the transformation are expressed in the transformed coordi-
   nate system. PDF applies the transformation matrix to ﬁnd the equivalent
   coordinates in the untransformed coordinate system.
Note: Many computer graphics textbooks consider transformations of graphics ob-
jects rather than of coordinate systems. Although either approach is correct and self-
consistent, some details of the calculations differ depending on which point of view is
taken.
PDF represents coordinates in a two-dimensional space. The point (x, y) in such
a space can be expressed in vector form as [x y 1]. The constant third element of
this vector (1) is needed so that the vector can be used with 3-by-3 matrices in the
calculations described below.
The transformation between two coordinate systems is represented by a 3-by-3
transformation matrix written as
       a b 0
       c d 0
       e f 1
Because a transformation matrix has only six elements that can be changed, it is
usually speciﬁed in PDF as the six-element array [a b c d e f].
Coordinate transformations are expressed as matrix multiplications:
                                a b 0
    [ x′ y′ 1 ] = [ x y 1 ] ×    c d 0
                                 e f 1
Because PDF transformation matrices specify the conversion from the trans-
formed coordinate system to the original (untransformed) coordinate system, x′
and y′ in this equation are the coordinates in the untransformed coordinate sys-
tem, while x and y are the coordinates in the transformed system. Carrying out
the multiplication, we have
    x′ = a × x + c × y + e
    y′ = b × x + d × y + f
If a series of transformations is carried out, the matrices representing each of the
individual transformations can be multiplied together to produce a single equiv-
alent matrix representing the composite transformation.
Matrix multiplication is not commutative—the order in which matrices are mul-
tiplied is signiﬁcant. Consider a sequence of two transformations: a scaling trans-
formation applied to the user space coordinate system, followed by a conversion
from the resulting scaled user space to device space. Let MS be the matrix specify-
ing the scaling and MC the current transformation matrix, which transforms user
space to device space. Recalling that coordinates are always speciﬁed in the trans-
formed space, the correct order of transformations must ﬁrst convert the scaled
coordinates to default user space and then the default user space coordinates to
device space. This can be expressed as
    XD = XU × MC = ( XS × MS ) × MC = XS × ( MS × MC )
where
   XD denotes the coordinates in device space
   XU denotes the coordinates in default user space
   XS denotes the coordinates in scaled user space
    This shows that when a new transformation is concatenated with an existing one,
    the matrix representing it must be multiplied before (premultiplied with) the
    existing transformation matrix.
    This result is true in general for PDF: when a sequence of transformations is car-
    ried out, the matrix representing the combined transformation (M′) is calculated
    by premultiplying the matrix representing the additional transformation (MT )
    with the one representing all previously existing transformations (M):
       M′ = M T × M
    Note: When rendering graphics objects, it is sometimes necessary for a viewer ap-
    plication to perform the inverse of a transformation—that is, to ﬁnd the user space
    coordinates that correspond to a given pair of device space coordinates. Not all trans-
    formations are invertible, however. For example, if a matrix contains a, b, c, and d
    elements that are all zero, all user coordinates map to the same device coordinates
    and there is no unique inverse transformation. Such noninvertible transformations
    are not very useful and generally arise from unintended operations, such as scaling
    by 0. Use of a noninvertible matrix when painting graphics objects can result in un-
    predictable behavior.
4.3 Graphics State
    A PDF viewer application maintains an internal data structure called the graphics
    state that holds current graphics control parameters. These parameters deﬁne the
    global framework within which the graphics operators execute. For example, the
    f (ﬁll) operator implicitly uses the current color parameter, and the S (stroke)
    operator additionally uses the current line width parameter from the graphics
    state.
    The graphics state is initialized at the beginning of each page, using the default
    values speciﬁed in Tables 4.2 and 4.3. Table 4.2 lists those graphics state parame-
    ters that are device-independent and are appropriate to specify in page descrip-
    tions. The parameters listed in Table 4.3 control details of the rendering (scan
    conversion) process and are device-dependent; a page description that is intend-
    ed to be device-independent should not modify these parameters.
                TABLE 4.2 Device-independent graphics state parameters
PARAMETER     TYPE              VALUE
CTM           array             The current transformation matrix, which maps positions from user
                                coordinates to device coordinates (see Section 4.2, “Coordinate Sys-
                                tems”). This matrix is modiﬁed by each application of the coordi-
                                nate transformation operator, cm. Initial value: a matrix that
                                transforms default user coordinates to device coordinates.
clipping path (internal)        The current clipping path, which deﬁnes the boundary against
                                which all output is to be cropped (see Section 4.4.3, “Clipping Path
                                Operators”). Initial value: the boundary of the entire imageable
                                portion of the output page.
color space   name or array     The current color space in which color values are to be interpreted
                                (see Section 4.5, “Color Spaces”). There are two separate color space
                                parameters: one for stroking and one for all other painting opera-
                                tions. Initial value: DeviceGray.
color         (various)         The current color to be used during painting operations (see Section
                                4.5, “Color Spaces”). The type and interpretation of this parameter
                                depend on the current color space; for most color spaces, a color
                                value consists of one to four numbers. There are two separate color
                                parameters: one for stroking and one for all other painting opera-
                                tions. Initial value: black.
text state    (various)         A set of nine graphics state parameters that pertain only to the
                                painting of text. These include parameters that select the font, scale
                                the glyphs to an appropriate size, and accomplish other effects. The
                                text state parameters are described in Section 5.2, “Text State
                                Parameters and Operators.”
line width    number            The thickness, in user space units, of paths to be stroked (see “Line
                                Width” on page 152). Initial value: 1.0.
line cap      integer           A code specifying the shape of the endpoints for any open path that
                                is stroked (see “Line Cap Style” on page 153). Initial value: 0, for
                                square butt caps.
line join     integer           A code specifying the shape of joints between connected segments
                                of a stroked path (see “Line Join Style” on page 153). Initial value: 0,
                                for mitered joins.
miter limit   number            The maximum length of mitered line joins for stroked paths (see
                                “Miter Limit” on page 153). This parameter limits the length of
                                “spikes” produced when line segments join at sharp angles. Initial
                                value: 10.0, for a miter cutoff below approximately 11.5 degrees.
dash pattern      array and     A description of the dash pattern to be used when paths are
                  number        stroked (see “Line Dash Pattern” on page 155). Initial value: a solid
                                line.
rendering intent  name          The rendering intent to be used when converting CIE-based colors
                                to device colors (see “Rendering Intents” on page 197). Default
                                value: RelativeColorimetric.
stroke adjustment boolean       (PDF 1.2) A ﬂag specifying whether to compensate for possible ras-
                                terization effects when stroking a path with a line width that is
                                small relative to the pixel resolution of the output device (see Sec-
                                tion 6.5.4, “Automatic Stroke Adjustment”). Note that this is con-
                                sidered a device-independent parameter, even though the details of
                                its effects are device-dependent. Initial value: false.
blend mode        name or array (PDF 1.4) The current blend mode to be used in the transparent
                                imaging model (see Sections 7.2.4, “Blend Mode,” and 7.5.2, “Spec-
                                ifying Blending Color Space and Blend Mode”). This parameter is
                                implicitly reset to its initial value at the beginning of execution of a
                                transparency group XObject (see Section 7.5.5, “Transparency
                                Group XObjects”). Initial value: Normal.
soft mask         dictionary    (PDF 1.4) A soft-mask dictionary (see “Soft-Mask Dictionaries” on
                  or name       page 445) specifying the mask shape or mask opacity values to be
                                used in the transparent imaging model (see “Source Shape and
                                Opacity” on page 421 and “Mask Shape and Opacity” on page 443),
                                or the name None if no such mask is speciﬁed. This parameter is
                                implicitly reset to its initial value at the beginning of execution of a
                                transparency group XObject (see Section 7.5.5, “Transparency
                                Group XObjects”). Initial value: None.
alpha constant    number        (PDF 1.4) The constant shape or constant opacity value to be used
                                in the transparent imaging model (see “Source Shape and Opacity”
                                on page 421 and “Constant Shape and Opacity” on page 444).
                                There are two separate alpha constant parameters: one for stroking
                                and one for all other painting operations. This parameter is implic-
                                itly reset to its initial value at the beginning of execution of a trans-
                                parency group XObject (see Section 7.5.5, “Transparency Group
                                XObjects”). Initial value: 1.0.
alpha source      boolean       (PDF 1.4) A ﬂag specifying whether the current soft mask and alpha
                                constant parameters are to be interpreted as shape values (true) or
                                opacity values (false). This ﬂag also governs the interpretation of
                                the SMask entry, if any, in an image dictionary (see Section 4.8.4,
                                “Image Dictionaries”). Initial value: false.
                       TABLE 4.3 Device-dependent graphics state parameters
PARAMETER          TYPE               VALUE
overprint          boolean            (PDF 1.2) A ﬂag specifying (on output devices that support the
                                      overprint control feature) whether painting in one set of colorants
                                      should cause the corresponding areas of other colorants to be
                                      erased (false) or left unchanged (true); see Section 4.5.6, “Over-
                                      print Control.” In PDF 1.3, there are two separate overprint param-
                                      eters: one for stroking and one for all other painting operations.
                                      Initial value: false.
overprint mode     number             (PDF 1.3) A code specifying whether a color component value of 0
                                      in a DeviceCMYK color space should erase that component (0) or
                                      leave it unchanged (1) when overprinting (see Section 4.5.6, “Over-
                                      print Control”). Initial value: 0.
black generation   function           (PDF 1.2) A function that calculates the level of the black color
                   or name            component to use when converting RGB colors to CMYK (see Sec-
                                      tion 6.2.3, “Conversion from DeviceRGB to DeviceCMYK”). Initial
                                      value: installation-dependent.
undercolor removal function           (PDF 1.2) A function that calculates the reduction in the levels of
                   or name            the cyan, magenta, and yellow color components to compensate for
                                      the amount of black added by black generation (see Section 6.2.3,
                                      “Conversion from DeviceRGB to DeviceCMYK”). Initial value: in-
                                      stallation-dependent.
transfer           function,          (PDF 1.2) A function that adjusts device gray or color component
                   array, or name     levels to compensate for nonlinear response in a particular out-
                                      put device (see Section 6.3, “Transfer Functions”). Initial value:
                                      installation-dependent.
halftone           dictionary,        (PDF 1.2) A halftone screen for gray and color rendering, speciﬁed
                   stream, or name    as a halftone dictionary or stream (see Section 6.4, “Halftones”).
                                      Initial value: installation-dependent.
ﬂatness            number             The precision with which curves are to be rendered on the output
                                      device (see Section 6.5.1, “Flatness Tolerance”). The value of this
                                      parameter gives the maximum error tolerance, measured in output
                                      device pixels; smaller numbers give smoother curves at the expense
                                      of more computation and memory use. Initial value: 1.0.
smoothness             number             (PDF 1.3) The precision with which color gradients are to be ren-
                                          dered on the output device (see Section 6.5.2, “Smoothness Toler-
                                          ance”). The value of this parameter gives the maximum error
                                          tolerance, expressed as a fraction of the range of each color compo-
                                          nent; smaller numbers give smoother color transitions at the
                                          expense of more computation and memory use. Initial value:
                                          installation-dependent.
         Some graphics state parameters are set with speciﬁc PDF operators, some are set
         by including a particular entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary, and some
         can be speciﬁed either way. The current line width, for example, can be set either
         with the w operator or (in PDF 1.3) with the LW entry in a graphics state param-
         eter dictionary, whereas the current color is set only with speciﬁc operators and
         the current halftone is set only with a graphics state parameter dictionary. It is
         expected that all future graphics state parameters will be speciﬁed with new
         entries in the graphics state parameter dictionary rather than with new operators.
         In general, the operators that set graphics state parameters simply store them un-
         changed for later use by the painting operators. However, some parameters have
         special properties or behavior:
         • Most parameters must be of the correct type or have values that fall within a
           certain range.
         • Parameters that are numeric values, such as the current color, line width, and
           miter limit, are forced into valid range, if necessary. However, they are not ad-
           justed to reﬂect capabilities of the raster output device, such as resolution or
           number of distinguishable colors. Painting operators perform such adjust-
           ments, but the adjusted values are not stored back into the graphics state.
         • Paths are internal objects that are not directly represented in PDF.
         Note: As indicated in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, some of the parameters—color space, color,
         and overprint—have two values, one used for stroking (of paths and text objects)
         and one for all other painting operations. The two parameter values can be set inde-
         pendently, allowing for operations such as combined ﬁlling and stroking of the same
         path with different colors. Except where noted, a term such as current color should
         be interpreted to refer to whichever color parameter applies to the operation being
         performed. When necessary, the individual color parameters are distinguished ex-
         plicitly as the stroking color and the nonstroking color.
4.3.1 Graphics State Stack
      A well-structured PDF document typically contains many graphical elements
      that are essentially independent of each other and sometimes nested to multiple
      levels. The graphics state stack allows these elements to make local changes to the
      graphics state without disturbing the graphics state of the surrounding environ-
      ment. The stack is a LIFO (last in, ﬁrst out) data structure in which the contents
      of the graphics state can be saved and later restored using the following operators:
      • The q operator pushes a copy of the entire graphics state onto the stack.
      • The Q operator restores the entire graphics state to its former value by popping
         it from the stack.
      These operators can be used to encapsulate a graphical element so that it can
      modify parameters of the graphics state and later restore them to their previous
      values. Occurrences of the q and Q operators must be balanced within a given
      content stream (or within the sequence of streams speciﬁed in a page dictionary’s
      Contents array).
4.3.2 Details of Graphics State Parameters
      This section gives details of several of the device-independent graphics state pa-
      rameters listed in Table 4.2 on page 148.
      Line Width
      The line width parameter speciﬁes the thickness of the line used to stroke a path.
      It is a nonnegative number expressed in user space units; stroking a path entails
      painting all points whose perpendicular distance from the path in user space is
      less than or equal to half the line width. The effect produced in device space
      depends on the current transformation matrix (CTM) in effect at the time the
      path is stroked. If the CTM speciﬁes scaling by different factors in the horizontal
      and vertical dimensions, the thickness of stroked lines in device space will vary
      according to their orientation. The actual line width achieved can differ from the
      requested width by as much as 2 device pixels, depending on the positions of
      lines with respect to the pixel grid. Automatic stroke adjustment can be used to
      ensure uniform line width; see Section 6.5.4, “Automatic Stroke Adjustment.”
      A line width of 0 denotes the thinnest line that can be rendered at device resolu-
      tion: 1 device pixel wide. However, some devices cannot reproduce 1-pixel lines,
      and on high-resolution devices, they are nearly invisible. Since the results of ren-
      dering such “zero-width” lines are device-dependent, their use is not recom-
      mended.
      Line Cap Style
      The line cap style speciﬁes the shape to be used at the ends of open subpaths (and
      dashes, if any) when they are stroked. Table 4.4 shows the possible values.
                                     TABLE 4.4 Line cap styles
STYLE     APPEARANCE          DESCRIPTION

                              for a distance equal to half the line width and is then squared off.
      Line Join Style
      The line join style speciﬁes the shape to be used at the corners of paths that are
      stroked. Table 4.5 shows the possible values. Join styles are signiﬁcant only at
      points where consecutive segments of a path connect at an angle; segments that
      meet or intersect fortuitously receive no special treatment.
      Miter Limit
      When two line segments meet at a sharp angle and mitered joins have been speci-
      ﬁed as the line join style, it is possible for the miter to extend far beyond the
      thickness of the line stroking the path. The miter limit imposes a maximum on
      the ratio of the miter length to the line width (see Figure 4.7). When the limit is
      exceeded, the join is converted from a miter to a bevel.

                                                 until they meet at an angle, as in a picture frame. If the segments meet at
                                                 too sharp an angle (as deﬁned by the miter limit parameter—see “Miter
                                                 Limit,” above), a bevel join is used instead.

                                                 the point where the two segments meet and is ﬁlled in, producing a round-

                                                 Note: If path segments shorter than half the line width meet at a sharp angle,
                                                 an unintended “wrong side” of the circle may appear.

                                                 Style” on page 153) and the resulting notch beyond the ends of the seg-
                                                 ments is ﬁlled with a triangle.
      The ratio of miter length to line width is directly related to the angle ϕ between
      the segments in user space by the formula

      For example, a miter limit of 1.414 converts miters to bevels for ϕ less than 90
      degrees, a limit of 2.0 converts them for ϕ less than 60 degrees, and a limit of 10.0
      converts them for ϕ less than approximately 11.5 degrees.

Line Dash Pattern
The line dash pattern controls the pattern of dashes and gaps used to stroke paths.
It is speciﬁed by a dash array and a dash phase. The dash array’s elements are
numbers that specify the lengths of alternating dashes and gaps; the dash phase
speciﬁes the distance into the dash pattern at which to start the dash. The ele-
ments of both the dash array and the dash phase are expressed in user space units.
Before beginning to stroke a path, the dash array is cycled through, adding up the
lengths of dashes and gaps. When the accumulated length equals the value speci-
ﬁed by the dash phase, stroking of the path begins, using the dash array cyclically
from that point onward. Table 4.6 shows examples of line dash patterns. As can
be seen from the table, an empty dash array and zero phase can be used to restore
the dash pattern to a solid line.

Dashed lines wrap around curves and corners just as solid stroked lines do. The
ends of each dash are treated with the current line cap style, and corners within
dashes are treated with the current line join style. A stroking operation takes no
measures to coordinate the dash pattern with features of the path; it simply dis-
penses dashes and gaps along the path in the pattern deﬁned by the dash array.
When a path consisting of several subpaths is stroked, each subpath is treated in-
dependently—that is, the dash pattern is restarted and the dash phase is reapplied
to it at the beginning of each subpath.
   4.3.3 Graphics State Operators
           Table 4.7 shows the operators that set the values of parameters in the graphics
           state. (See also the color operators listed in Table 4.21 on page 216 and the text
           state operators in Table 5.2 on page 302.)

—                          Q         Restore the graphics state by removing the most recently saved state from
                                     the stack and making it the current state (see “Graphics State Stack” on
                                     page 152).

                                     speciﬁed matrix (see Section 4.2.1, “Coordinate Spaces”). Although the
                                     operands specify a matrix, they are written as six separate numbers, not as
                                     an array.
lineWidth                  w         Set the line width in the graphics state (see “Line Width” on page 152).
lineCap                    J         Set the line cap style in the graphics state (see “Line Cap Style” on page
                                     153).
lineJoin                   j         Set the line join style in the graphics state (see “Line Join Style” on page
                                     153).
miterLimit                 M         Set the miter limit in the graphics state (see “Miter Limit” on page 153).
dashArray dashPhase        d         Set the line dash pattern in the graphics state (see “Line Dash Pattern” on
                                     page 155).
intent                     ri        (PDF 1.1) Set the color rendering intent in the graphics state (see “Ren-
                                     dering Intents” on page 197).
ﬂatness                    i         Set the ﬂatness tolerance in the graphics state (see Section 6.5.1, “Flatness
                                     Tolerance”). ﬂatness is a number in the range 0 to 100; a value of 0 speci-
                                     ﬁes the output device’s default ﬂatness tolerance.
dictName                   gs        (PDF 1.2) Set the speciﬁed parameters in the graphics state. dictName is
                                     the name of a graphics state parameter dictionary in the ExtGState sub-
                                     dictionary of the current resource dictionary (see the next section).
   4.3.4 Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries
         While some parameters in the graphics state can be set with individual operators,
         as shown in Table 4.7, others cannot. The latter can only be set with the generic
         graphics state operator gs (PDF 1.2). The operand supplied to this operator is the
         name of a graphics state parameter dictionary whose contents specify the values of
         one or more graphics state parameters. This name is looked up in the ExtGState
         subdictionary of the current resource dictionary. (The name ExtGState, for
         “extended graphics state,” is a vestige of earlier versions of PDF.)
         Note: The graphics state parameter dictionary is also used by type 2 patterns, which
         do not have a content stream in which the graphics state operators could be invoked
         (see Section 4.6.3, “Shading Patterns”).
         Each entry in the parameter dictionary speciﬁes the value of an individual graph-
         ics state parameter, as shown in Table 4.8. It is not necessary for all entries to be
         present for every invocation of the gs operator; the parameter dictionary sup-
         plied may include any desired combination of parameter entries. The results of
         gs are cumulative; parameter values established in previous invocations will per-
         sist until explicitly overridden. Note that some parameters appear in both Tables
         4.7 and 4.8; these parameters can be set either with individual graphics state
         operators or with gs. It is expected that any future extensions to the graphics state
         will be implemented by adding new entries to the graphics state parameter dic-
         tionary, rather than by introducing new graphics state operators.

Example 4.1 shows two graphics state parameter dictionaries. In the ﬁrst, auto-
matic stroke adjustment is turned on, and the dictionary includes a transfer func-
tion that inverts its value, f(x) = 1 − x. In the second, overprint is turned off, and
the dictionary includes a parabolic transfer function, f(x) = (2x − 1) 2, with a
sample of 21 values. The domain of the transfer function, [0.0 1.0], is mapped to
[0 20], and the range of the sample values, [0 255], is mapped to the range of
the transfer function, [0.0 1.0].

4.4 Path Construction and Painting
    Paths deﬁne shapes, trajectories, and regions of all sorts. They are used to draw
    lines, deﬁne the shapes of ﬁlled areas, and specify boundaries for clipping other
    graphics. The graphics state includes a current clipping path that deﬁnes the clip-
    ping boundary for the current page. At the beginning of each page, the clipping
    path is initialized to include the entire page.
    A path is composed of straight and curved line segments, which may connect to
    one another or may be disconnected. A pair of segments are said to connect only
    if they are deﬁned consecutively, with the second segment starting where the ﬁrst
    one ends. Thus the order in which the segments of a path are deﬁned is signiﬁ-
    cant. Nonconsecutive segments that meet or intersect fortuitously are not consid-
    ered to connect.
      A path is made up of one or more disconnected subpaths, each comprising a se-
      quence of connected segments. The topology of the path is unrestricted: it may
      be concave or convex, may contain multiple subpaths representing disjoint areas,
      and may intersect itself in arbitrary ways. There is an operator, h, that explicitly
      connects the end of a subpath back to its starting point; such a subpath is said to
      be closed. A subpath that has not been explicitly closed is open.
      As discussed in Section 4.1, “Graphics Objects,” a path object is deﬁned by a se-
      quence of operators to construct the path, followed by one or more operators to
      paint the path or to use it as a clipping boundary. PDF path operators fall into
      three categories:
      • Path construction operators (Section 4.4.1) deﬁne the geometry of a path. A
        path is constructed by sequentially applying one or more of these operators.
      • Path-painting operators (Section 4.4.2) end a path object, usually causing the
        object to be painted on the current page in any of a variety of ways.
      • Clipping path operators (Section 4.4.3), invoked immediately prior to a path-
        painting operator, cause the path object also to be used for clipping of sub-
        sequent graphics objects.
4.4.1 Path Construction Operators
      A page description begins with an empty path and builds up its deﬁnition by in-
      voking one or more path construction operators to add segments to it. The path
      construction operators may be invoked in any sequence, but the ﬁrst one invoked
      must be m or re to begin a new subpath. The path deﬁnition concludes with the
      application of a path-painting operator such as S, f, or b (see Section 4.4.2, “Path-
      Painting Operators”); this may optionally be preceded by one of the clipping path
      operators W or W* (Section 4.4.3, “Clipping Path Operators”). Note that the path
      construction operators in themselves do not place any marks on the page; only
      the painting operators do that. A path deﬁnition is not complete until a path-
      painting operator has been applied to it.
      The path currently under construction is called the current path. In PDF (unlike
      PostScript), the current path is not part of the graphics state and is not saved and
      restored along with the other graphics state parameters. PDF paths are strictly in-
      ternal objects with no explicit representation. Once a path has been painted, it is
           no longer deﬁned; there is then no current path until a new one is begun with the
           m or re operator.
           The trailing endpoint of the segment most recently added to the current path is
           referred to as the current point. If the current path is empty, the current point is
           undeﬁned. Most operators that add a segment to the current path start at the cur-
           rent point; if the current point is undeﬁned, they generate an error.
           Table 4.9 shows the path construction operators. All operands are numbers de-
           noting coordinates in user space.

          Cubic Bézier Curves
          Curved path segments are speciﬁed as cubic Bézier curves. Such curves are deﬁned
          by four points: the two endpoints (the current point P0 and the ﬁnal point P3 )
          and two control points P1 and P2 . Given the coordinates of the four points, the
          curve is generated by varying the parameter t from 0.0 to 1.0 in the following
          equation:
                               3                  2         2                3
              R (t) = ( 1 – t ) P 0 + 3t ( 1 – t ) P 1 + 3t ( 1 – t )P 2 + t P 3
          When t = 0.0, the value of the function R(t) coincides with the current point P0 ;
          when t = 1.0, R(t) coincides with the ﬁnal point P3 . Intermediate values of t gen-
          erate intermediate points along the curve. The curve does not, in general, pass
          through the two control points P1 and P2 .
          Cubic Bézier curves have two desirable properties:
          • The curve can be very quickly split into smaller pieces for rapid rendering.
          • The curve is contained within the convex hull of the four points deﬁning the
             curve, most easily visualized as the polygon obtained by stretching a rubber
             band around the outside of the four points. This property allows rapid testing
             of whether the curve lies completely outside the visible region, and hence does
             not have to be rendered.
The Bibliography lists several books that describe cubic Bézier curves in more
depth.
The most general PDF operator for constructing curved path segments is the c
operator, which speciﬁes the coordinates of points P1 , P2 , and P3 explicitly, as
shown in Figure 4.8. (The starting point, P0 , is deﬁned implicitly by the current
point.)

Two more operators, v and y, each specify one of the two control points implic-
itly (see Figure 4.9). In both of these cases, one control point and the ﬁnal point
of the curve are supplied as operands; the other control point is implied, as fol-
lows:
• For the v operator, the ﬁrst control point coincides with initial point of the
   curve.
• For the y operator, the second control point coincides with ﬁnal point of the
   curve.

4.4.2 Path-Painting Operators
        The path-painting operators end a path object, causing it to be painted on the
        current page in the manner that the operator speciﬁes. The principal path-
        painting operators are S (for stroking) and f (for ﬁlling). Variants of these opera-
        tors combine stroking and ﬁlling in a single operation or apply different rules for
        determining the area to be ﬁlled. Table 4.10 lists all the path-painting operators.
        Stroking
        The S operator paints a line along the current path. The stroked line follows each
        straight or curved segment in the path, centered on the segment with sides paral-
        lel to it. Each of the path’s subpaths is treated separately.
        The results of the S operator depend on the current settings of various parame-
        ters in the graphics state. See Section 4.3, “Graphics State,” for further informa-
        tion on these parameters.
                            TABLE 4.10 Path-painting operators
OPERANDS OPERATOR DESCRIPTION
—           S     Stroke the path.
—           s     Close and stroke the path. This operator has the same effect as the sequence h S.
—           f     Fill the path, using the nonzero winding number rule to determine the region to ﬁll
                  (see “Nonzero Winding Number Rule” on page 169).
—           F     Equivalent to f; included only for compatibility. Although applications that read
                  PDF ﬁles must be able to accept this operator, those that generate PDF ﬁles should
                  use f instead.
—           f*    Fill the path, using the even-odd rule to determine the region to ﬁll (see “Even-Odd
                  Rule” on page 170).
—           B     Fill and then stroke the path, using the nonzero winding number rule to determine
                  the region to ﬁll. This produces the same result as constructing two identical path
                  objects, painting the ﬁrst with f and the second with S. Note, however, that the ﬁll-
                  ing and stroking portions of the operation consult different values of several graph-
                  ics state parameters, such as the current color. See also “Special Path-Painting
                  Considerations” on page 462.
—           B*    Fill and then stroke the path, using the even-odd rule to determine the region to ﬁll.
                  This operator produces the same result as B, except that the path is ﬁlled as if with
                  f* instead of f. See also “Special Path-Painting Considerations” on page 462.
—           b     Close, ﬁll, and then stroke the path, using the nonzero winding number rule to de-
                  termine the region to ﬁll. This operator has the same effect as the sequence h B. See
                  also “Special Path-Painting Considerations” on page 462.
—           b*    Close, ﬁll, and then stroke the path, using the even-odd rule to determine the re-
                  gion to ﬁll. This operator has the same effect as the sequence h B*. See also “Special
                  Path-Painting Considerations” on page 462.
—           n     End the path object without ﬁlling or stroking it. This operator is a “path-painting
                  no-op,” used primarily for the side effect of changing the current clipping path (see
                  Section 4.4.3, “Clipping Path Operators”).
• The width of the stroked line is determined by the current line width parame-
   ter (“Line Width” on page 152).
• The color or pattern of the line is determined by the current color and color
   space for stroking operations.
• The line can be painted either solid or with a dash pattern, as speciﬁed by the
   current line dash pattern (“Line Dash Pattern” on page 155).
• If a subpath is open, the unconnected ends are treated according to the current
   line cap style, which may be butt, rounded, or square (“Line Cap Style” on page
   153).
• Wherever two consecutive segments are connected, the joint between them is
   treated according to the current line join style, which may be mitered, rounded,
   or beveled (“Line Join Style” on page 153). Mitered joins are also subject to the
   current miter limit (“Miter Limit” on page 153).
   Note: Points at which unconnected segments happen to meet or intersect receive no
   special treatment. In particular, “closing” a subpath with an explicit l operator
   rather than with h may result in a messy corner, because line caps will be applied
   instead of a line join.
• The stroke adjustment parameter (PDF 1.2) speciﬁes that coordinates and line
   widths be adjusted automatically to produce strokes of uniform thickness
   despite rasterization effects (Section 6.5.4, “Automatic Stroke Adjustment”).
If a subpath is degenerate (consists of a single-point closed path or of two or
more points at the same coordinates), the S operator paints it only if round line
caps have been speciﬁed, producing a ﬁlled circle centered at the single point. If
butt or projecting square line caps have been speciﬁed, S produces no output,
because the orientation of the caps would be indeterminate. (Note that this rule
applies only to zero-length subpaths of the path being stroked, and not to zero-
length dashes in a dash pattern. In the latter case, the line caps are always paint-
ed, since their orientation is determined by the direction of the underlying
path.) A single-point open subpath (speciﬁed by a trailing m operator) produces
no output.
Filling
The f operator uses the current nonstroking color to paint the entire region en-
closed by the current path. If the path consists of several disconnected subpaths, f
paints the insides of all subpaths, considered together. Any subpaths that are
open are implicitly closed before being ﬁlled.
If a subpath is degenerate (consists of a single-point closed path or of two or
more points at the same coordinates), f paints the single device pixel lying under
that point; the result is device-dependent and not generally useful. A single-point
open subpath (speciﬁed by a trailing m operator) produces no output.
For a simple path, it is intuitively clear what region lies inside. However, for a
more complex path—for example, a path that intersects itself or has one subpath
that encloses another—the interpretation of “inside” is not always obvious. The
path machinery uses one of two rules for determining which points lie inside a
path: the nonzero winding number rule and the even-odd rule, both discussed in
detail below.
The nonzero winding number rule is more versatile than the even-odd rule and is
the standard rule the f operator uses. Similarly, the W operator uses this rule to
determine the inside of the current clipping path. The even-odd rule is occasion-
ally useful for special effects or for compatibility with other graphics systems; the
f* and W* operators invoke this rule.
Nonzero Winding Number Rule
The nonzero winding number rule determines whether a given point is inside a
path by conceptually drawing a ray from that point to inﬁnity in any direction
and then examining the places where a segment of the path crosses the ray. Start-
ing with a count of 0, the rule adds 1 each time a path segment crosses the ray
from left to right and subtracts 1 each time a segment crosses from right to left.
After counting all the crossings, if the result is 0 then the point is outside the path;
otherwise it is inside.
Note: The method just described does not specify what to do if a path segment coin-
cides with or is tangent to the chosen ray. Since the direction of the ray is arbitrary,
the rule simply chooses a ray that does not encounter such problem intersections.
For simple convex paths, the nonzero winding number rule deﬁnes the inside
and outside as one would intuitively expect. The more interesting cases are those
involving complex or self-intersecting paths like the ones shown in Figure 4.10.
For a path consisting of a ﬁve-pointed star, drawn with ﬁve connected straight
line segments intersecting each other, the rule considers the inside to be the entire
area enclosed by the star, including the pentagon in the center. For a path com-
posed of two concentric circles, the areas enclosed by both circles are considered
to be inside, provided that both are drawn in the same direction. If the circles are
drawn in opposite directions, only the “doughnut” shape between them is inside,
according to the rule; the “doughnut hole” is outside.
                      FIGURE 4.10 Nonzero winding number rule
Even-Odd Rule
An alternative to the nonzero winding number rule is the even-odd rule. This rule
determines the “insideness” of a point by drawing a ray from that point in any
direction and simply counting the number of path segments that cross the ray,
regardless of direction. If this number is odd, the point is inside; if even, the point
is outside. This yields the same results as the nonzero winding number rule for
paths with simple shapes, but produces different results for more complex
shapes.
Figure 4.11 shows the effects of applying the even-odd rule to complex paths. For
the ﬁve-pointed star, the rule considers the triangular points to be inside the
path, but not the pentagon in the center. For the two concentric circles, only the
“doughnut” shape between the two circles is considered inside, regardless of the
directions in which the circles are drawn.
                                     FIGURE 4.11 Even-odd rule
4.4.3 Clipping Path Operators
      The graphics state contains a current clipping path that limits the regions of the
      page affected by painting operators. The closed subpaths of this path deﬁne the
      area that can be painted. Marks falling inside this area will be applied to the page;
      those falling outside it will not. (Precisely what is considered to be “inside” a path
      is discussed under “Filling,” above.)
      Note: In the context of the transparent imaging model (PDF 1.4), the current clip-
      ping path constrains an object’s shape (see Section 7.1, “Overview of Transparency”).
      The effective shape is the intersection of the object’s intrinsic shape with the clipping
      path; the source shape value is 0.0 outside this intersection. Similarly, the shape of a
      transparency group (deﬁned as the union of the shapes of its constituent objects) is
      inﬂuenced both by the clipping path in effect when each of the objects is painted and
      by the one in effect at the time the group’s results are painted onto its backdrop.
      The initial clipping path includes the entire page. A clipping path operator (W or
      W*, shown in Table 4.11) may appear after the last path construction operator
      and before the path-painting operator that terminates a path object. Although
      the clipping path operator appears before the painting operator, it does not alter
      the clipping path at the point where it appears. Rather, it modiﬁes the effect of
      the succeeding painting operator. After the path has been painted, the clipping
      path in the graphics state is set to the intersection of the current clipping path
      and the newly constructed path.
                                   TABLE 4.11 Clipping path operators
OPERANDS     OPERATOR      DESCRIPTION
—               W          Modify the current clipping path by intersecting it with the current path, using the
                           nonzero winding number rule to determine which regions lie inside the clipping
                           path.
—               W*         Modify the current clipping path by intersecting it with the current path, using the
                           even-odd rule to determine which regions lie inside the clipping path.
         Note: In addition to path objects, text objects can also be used for clipping; see Sec-
         tion 5.2.5, “Text Rendering Mode.”
         The n operator (see Table 4.10 on page 167) is a “no-op” path-painting operator;
         it causes no marks to be placed on the page, but can be used with a clipping path
         operator to establish a new clipping path. That is, after a path has been con-
         structed, the sequence W n will intersect that path with the current clipping path
         to establish a new clipping path.
         There is no way to enlarge the current clipping path or to set a new clipping path
         without reference to the current one. However, since the clipping path is part of
         the graphics state, its effect can be localized to speciﬁc graphics objects by en-
         closing the modiﬁcation of the clipping path and the painting of those objects
         between a pair of q and Q operators (see Section 4.3.1, “Graphics State Stack”).
         Execution of the Q operator causes the clipping path to revert to the value that
         was saved by the q operator, before the clipping path was modiﬁed.
   4.5 Color Spaces
         PDF includes powerful facilities for specifying the colors of graphics objects to be
         painted on the current page. The color facilities are divided into two parts:
         • Color speciﬁcation. A PDF ﬁle can specify abstract colors in a device-
            independent way. Colors can be described in any of a variety of color systems,
            or color spaces. Some color spaces are related to device color representation
            (grayscale, RGB, CMYK), others to human visual perception (CIE-based). Cer-
            tain special features are also modeled as color spaces: patterns, color mapping,
            separations, and high-ﬁdelity and multitone color.
      • Color rendering. The viewer application reproduces colors on the raster output
         device by a multiple-step process that includes some combination of color con-
         version, gamma correction, halftoning, and scan conversion. Some aspects of
         this process use information that is speciﬁed in PDF. However, unlike the facil-
         ities for color speciﬁcation, the color rendering facilities are device-dependent
         and ordinarily should not be included in a page description.
      Figures 4.12 and 4.13 on pages 174 and 175 illustrate the division between PDF’s
      (device-independent) color speciﬁcation and (device-dependent) color render-
      ing facilities. This section describes the color speciﬁcation features, covering
      everything that most PDF documents need in order to specify colors. The facili-
      ties for controlling color rendering are described in Chapter 6; a PDF document
      should use these facilities only to conﬁgure or calibrate an output device or to
      achieve special device-dependent effects.
4.5.1 Color Values
      As described in Section 4.4.2, “Path-Painting Operators,” marks placed on the
      page by operators such as f and S have a color that is determined by the current
      color parameter of the graphics state. A color value consists of one or more color
      components, which are usually numbers. For example, a gray level can be speci-
      ﬁed by a single number ranging from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white). Full color values
      can be speciﬁed in any of several ways; a common method uses three numeric
      values to specify red, green, and blue components.
      Color values are interpreted according to the current color space, another param-
      eter of the graphics state. A PDF content stream ﬁrst selects a color space by
      invoking the CS operator (for the stroking color) or the cs operator (for the
      nonstroking color). It then selects color values within that color space with the
      SC operator (stroking) or the sc operator (nonstroking). There are also conve-
      nience operators—G, g, RG, rg, K, and k—that select both a color space and a
      color value within it in a single step. Table 4.21 on page 216 lists all the color-
      setting operators.
      Sampled images (see Section 4.8, “Images”) specify the color values of individual
      samples with respect to a color space designated by the image object itself. While
      these values are independent of the current color space and color parameters in
      the graphics state, all later stages of color processing treat them in exactly the
      same way as color values speciﬁed with the SC or sc operator.

4.5.2 Color Space Families
      Color spaces can be classiﬁed into color space families. Spaces within a family
      share the same general characteristics; they are distinguished by parameter values
      supplied at the time the space is speciﬁed. The families, in turn, fall into three
      broad categories:
      • Device color spaces directly specify colors or shades of gray that the output
        device is to produce. They provide a variety of color speciﬁcation methods,
        including grayscale, RGB (red-green-blue), and CMYK (cyan-magenta-yellow-
        black), corresponding to the color space families DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, and
        DeviceCMYK. Since each of these families consists of just a single color space
        with no parameters, they are often loosely referred to as the DeviceGray,
        DeviceRGB, and DeviceCMYK color spaces.
      • CIE-based color spaces are based on an international standard for color speciﬁ-
        cation created by the Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage (International
        Commission on Illumination). These spaces allow colors to be speciﬁed in a
        way that is independent of the characteristics of any particular output device.
        Color space families in this category include CalGray, CalRGB, Lab, and ICC-
        Based. Individual color spaces within these families are speciﬁed by means of
        dictionaries containing the parameter values needed to deﬁne the space.
      • Special color spaces add features or properties to an underlying color space.
        They include facilities for patterns, color mapping, separations, and high-
        ﬁdelity and multitone color. The corresponding color space families are
        Pattern, Indexed, Separation, and DeviceN. Individual color spaces within
        these families are speciﬁed by means of additional parameters.
      Table 4.12 summarizes the color space families supported by PDF. (See imple-
      mentation note 31 in Appendix H.)

A color space is deﬁned by an array object whose ﬁrst element is a name object
identifying the color space family. The remaining array elements, if any, are
parameters that further characterize the color space; their number and types vary
according to the particular family. For families that do not require parameters,
the color space can be speciﬁed simply by the family name itself instead of an
array.
There are two principal ways in which a color space can be speciﬁed:
• Within a content stream, the CS or cs operator establishes the current color
  space parameter in the graphics state. The operand is always a name object,
  which either identiﬁes one of the color spaces that need no additional parame-
  ters (DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, or some cases of Pattern) or is used
  as a key in the ColorSpace subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see
  Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries”). In the latter case, the value of the dic-
  tionary entry is in turn a color space array or name. A color space array is never
  permitted inline within a content stream.
• Outside a content stream, certain objects, such as image XObjects, specify a
  color space as an explicit parameter, often associated with the key ColorSpace.
  In this case, the color space array or name is always deﬁned directly as a PDF
  object, not by an entry in the ColorSpace resource subdictionary. This conven-
  tion also applies when color spaces are deﬁned in terms of other color spaces.
The following operators set the current color space and current color parameters
in the graphics state:
• CS sets the stroking color space; cs sets the nonstroking color space.
• SC and SCN set the stroking color; sc and scn set the nonstroking color. De-
  pending on the color space, these operators require one or more operands,
  each specifying one component of the color value.
• G, RG, and K set the stroking color space implicitly and the stroking color as
  speciﬁed by the operands; g, rg, and k do the same for the nonstroking color
  space and color.
4.5.3 Device Color Spaces
      The device color spaces enable a page description to specify color values that are
      directly related to their representation on an output device. Color values in these
      spaces map directly (or via simple conversions) to the application of device color-
      ants, such as quantities of ink or intensities of display phosphors. This enables a
      PDF document to control colors precisely for a particular device, but the results
      may not be consistent from one device to another.
      Output devices form colors either by adding light sources together or by sub-
      tracting light from an illuminating source. Computer displays and ﬁlm recorders
      typically add colors, while printing inks typically subtract them. These two ways
      of forming colors give rise to two complementary methods of color speciﬁcation,
      called additive and subtractive color (see Plate 1). The most widely used forms of
      these two types of color speciﬁcation are known as RGB and CMYK, respectively,
      for the names of the primary colors on which they’re based. The corresponding
      device color spaces are as follows:
      •  DeviceGray controls the intensity of achromatic light, on a scale from black to
         white.
      •  DeviceRGB controls the intensities of red, green, and blue light, the three addi-
         tive primary colors used in displays.
      •  DeviceCMYK controls the concentrations of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black
         inks, the four subtractive process colors used in printing.
      Although the notion of explicit color spaces is a PDF 1.1 feature, the operators for
      specifying colors in the device color spaces—G, g, RG, rg, K, and k—are available
      in all versions of PDF. Beginning with PDF 1.2, colors speciﬁed in device color
      spaces can optionally be remapped systematically into other color spaces; see
      “Default Color Spaces” on page 194.
      Note: In the transparent imaging model (PDF 1.4), the use of device color spaces is
      subject to special treatment within a transparency group whose group color space is
      CIE-based (see Sections 7.3, “Transparency Groups,” and 7.5.5, “Transparency
      Group XObjects”). In particular, the device color space operators should be used only
      if device color spaces have been remapped to CIE-based spaces by means of the
      default color space mechanism. Otherwise, the results will be implementation-
      dependent and unpredictable.
DeviceGray Color Space
Black, white, and intermediate shades of gray are special cases of full color. A
grayscale value is represented by a single number in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where
0.0 corresponds to black, 1.0 to white, and intermediate values to different gray
levels. Example 4.2 shows alternative ways to select the DeviceGray color space
and a speciﬁc gray level within that space for stroking operations.
Example 4.2
   /DeviceGray CS                          % Set DeviceGray color space
   gray SC                                 % Set gray level
   gray G                                  % Set both in one operation
The CS and SC operators select the current stroking color space and current
stroking color separately; G sets them in combination. (The cs, sc, and g opera-
tors perform the same functions for nonstroking operations.) Setting either cur-
rent color space to DeviceGray initializes the corresponding current color to 0.0.
DeviceRGB Color Space
Colors in the DeviceRGB color space are speciﬁed according to the additive RGB
(red-green-blue) color model, in which color values are deﬁned by three compo-
nents representing the intensities of the additive primary colorants red, green,
and blue. Each component is speciﬁed by a number in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where
0.0 denotes the complete absence of a primary component and 1.0 denotes maxi-
mum intensity. If all three components have equal intensity, the perceived result
theoretically is a pure gray on the scale from black to white. If the intensities are
not all equal, the result is some color other than a pure gray.
Example 4.3 shows alternative ways to select the DeviceRGB color space and a
speciﬁc color within that space for stroking operations.
Example 4.3
   /DeviceRGB CS                           % Set DeviceRGB color space
   red green blue SC                       % Set color
   red green blue RG                       % Set both in one operation
The CS and SC operators select the current stroking color space and current
stroking color separately; RG sets them in combination. (The cs, sc, and rg opera-
tors perform the same functions for nonstroking operations.) Setting either cur-
rent color space to DeviceRGB initializes the red, green, and blue components of
the corresponding current color to 0.0.
DeviceCMYK Color Space
The DeviceCMYK color space allows colors to be speciﬁed according to the sub-
tractive CMYK (cyan-magenta-yellow-black) model typical of printers and other
paper-based output devices. In theory, each of the three standard process colorants
used in printing (cyan, magenta, and yellow) absorbs one of the additive primary
colors (red, green, and blue, respectively). Black, a fourth standard process color-
ant, absorbs all of the additive primaries in equal amounts. The four components
in a DeviceCMYK color value represent the concentrations of these process color-
ants. Each component is speciﬁed by a number in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0
denotes the complete absence of a process colorant (that is, absorbs none of the
corresponding additive primary) and 1.0 denotes maximum concentration (ab-
sorbs as much as possible of the additive primary). Note that the sense of these
numbers is opposite to that of RGB color components.
Example 4.4 shows alternative ways to select the DeviceCMYK color space and a
speciﬁc color within that space for stroking operations.
Example 4.4
   /DeviceCMYK CS                         % Set DeviceCMYK color space
   cyan magenta yellow black SC           % Set color
   cyan magenta yellow black K            % Set both in one operation
The CS and SC operators select the current stroking color space and current
stroking color separately; K sets them in combination. (The cs, sc, and k operators
perform the same functions for nonstroking operations.) Setting either current
color space to DeviceCMYK initializes the cyan, magenta, and yellow components
of the corresponding current color to 0.0 and the black component to 1.0.
4.5.4 CIE-Based Color Spaces
      Calibrated color in PDF is deﬁned in terms of an international standard used in
      the graphic arts, television, and printing industries. CIE-based color spaces en-
      able a page description to specify color values in a way that is related to human
      visual perception. The goal is for the same color speciﬁcation to produce consis-
      tent results on different output devices, within the limitations of each device;
      Plate 2 illustrates the kind of variation in color reproduction that can result from
      the use of uncalibrated color on different devices. PDF 1.1 supports three CIE-
      based color space families, named CalGray, CalRGB, and Lab; PDF 1.3 adds a
      fourth, named ICCBased.
      Note: In PDF 1.1, a color space family named CalCMYK was partially deﬁned, with
      the expectation that its deﬁnition would be completed in a future version. However,
      this is no longer being considered. PDF 1.3 and later versions support calibrated
      four-component color spaces by means of ICC proﬁles (see “ICCBased Color Spaces”
      on page 189). PDF consumer applications should ignore CalCMYK color space at-
      tributes and render colors speciﬁed in this family as if they had been speciﬁed using
      DeviceCMYK.
      The details of the CIE colorimetric system and the theory on which it is based are
      beyond the scope of this book; see the Bibliography for sources of further in-
      formation. The semantics of CIE-based color spaces are deﬁned in terms of the
      relationship between the space’s components and the tristimulus values X, Y, and
      Z of the CIE 1931 XYZ space. The CalRGB and Lab color spaces (PDF 1.1) are
      special cases of three-component CIE-based color spaces, known as CIE-based
      ABC color spaces. These spaces are deﬁned in terms of a two-stage, nonlinear
      transformation of the CIE 1931 XYZ space. The formulation of such color spaces
      models a simple zone theory of color vision, consisting of a nonlinear trichro-
      matic ﬁrst stage combined with a nonlinear opponent-color second stage. This
      formulation allows colors to be digitized with minimum loss of ﬁdelity, an im-
      portant consideration in sampled images.
      Color values in a CIE-based ABC color space have three components, arbitrarily
      named A, B, and C. The ﬁrst stage transforms these components by ﬁrst forcing
      their values to a speciﬁed range, then applying decoding functions, and ﬁnally
      multiplying the results by a 3-by-3 matrix, producing three intermediate com-
      ponents arbitrarily named L, M, and N. The second stage transforms these inter-
      mediate components in a similar fashion, producing the ﬁnal X, Y, and Z
      components of the CIE 1931 XYZ space (see Figure 4.14).

        FIGURE 4.14 Component transformations in a CIE-based ABC color space
Color spaces in the CIE-based families are deﬁned by an array
   [name dictionary]
where name is the name of the family and dictionary is a dictionary containing
parameters that further characterize the space. The entries in this dictionary have
speciﬁc interpretations that vary depending on the color space; some entries are
required and some are optional. See the sections on speciﬁc color space families,
below, for details.
Setting the current stroking or nonstroking color space to any CIE-based color
space initializes all components of the corresponding current color to 0.0 (unless
the range of valid values for a given component does not include 0.0, in which
case the nearest valid value is substituted.)
Note: The model and terminology used here—CIE-based ABC (above) and CIE-
based A (below)—are derived from the PostScript language, which supports these
color space families in their full generality. PDF supports speciﬁc useful cases of CIE-
based ABC and CIE-based A spaces; most others can be represented as ICCBased
spaces.
CalGray Color Spaces
A CalGray color space (PDF 1.1) is a special case of a single-component CIE-
based color space, known as a CIE-based A color space. This type of space is the
one-dimensional (and usually achromatic) analog of CIE-based ABC spaces.
Color values in a CIE-based A space have a single component, arbitrarily named
A. Figure 4.15 illustrates the transformations of the A component to X, Y, and Z
components of the CIE 1931 XYZ space.

           A CalGray color space is a CIE-based A color space with only one transformation
           stage instead of two. In this type of space, A represents the gray component of a
           calibrated gray space. This component must be in the range 0.0 to 1.0. The de-
           coding function (denoted by “Decode A” in Figure 4.15) is a gamma function
           whose coefﬁcient is speciﬁed by the Gamma entry in the color space dictionary
           (see Table 4.13). The transformation matrix denoted by “Matrix A” in the ﬁgure
           is derived from the dictionary’s WhitePoint entry, as described below. Since there
           is no second transformation stage, “Decode LMN” and “Matrix LMN” are im-
           plicitly taken to be identity transformations.

   Y = M = YW × A
                        G
   Z = N = ZW × A
In other words, the A component is ﬁrst decoded by the gamma function, and the
result is multiplied by the components of the white point to obtain the L, M, and
N components of the intermediate representation. Since there is no second stage,
these are also the X, Y, and Z components of the ﬁnal representation.
The following examples illustrate interesting and useful special cases of CalGray
spaces. Example 4.5 establishes a space consisting of the Y dimension of the CIE
1931 XYZ space with the CCIR XA/11–recommended D65 white point.

CalRGB Color Spaces
A CalRGB color space is a CIE-based ABC color space with only one transforma-
tion stage instead of two. In this type of space, A, B, and C represent calibrated
red, green, and blue color values. These three color components must be in the
range 0.0 to 1.0; component values falling outside that range will be adjusted to
the nearest valid value without error indication. The decoding functions
(denoted by “Decode ABC” in Figure 4.14 on page 182) are gamma functions
whose coefﬁcients are speciﬁed by the Gamma entry in the color space dictionary
           (see Table 4.14). The transformation matrix denoted by “Matrix ABC” in Figure
           4.14 is deﬁned by the dictionary’s Matrix entry. Since there is no second transfor-
           mation stage, “Decode LMN” and “Matrix LMN” are implicitly taken to be iden-
           tity transformations.

           The WhitePoint and BlackPoint entries in the color space dictionary control the
           overall effect of the CIE-based gamut mapping function described in Section 6.1,
           “CIE-Based Color to Device Color.” Typically, the colors speciﬁed by WhitePoint
           and BlackPoint are mapped to the nearly lightest and nearly darkest achromatic
           colors that the output device is capable of rendering in a way that preserves color
           appearance and visual contrast.
           WhitePoint is assumed to represent the diffuse achromatic highlight, not a specu-
           lar highlight. Specular highlights, achromatic or otherwise, are often reproduced
           lighter than the diffuse highlight. BlackPoint is assumed to represent the diffuse
           achromatic shadow; its value is typically limited by the dynamic range of the in-
           put device. In images produced by a photographic system, the values of White-
           Point and BlackPoint vary with exposure, system response, and artistic intent;
           hence, their values are image-dependent.
The transformation deﬁned by the Gamma and Matrix entries in the CalRGB
color space dictionary is
                       GR           GG          GB
    X = L = XA × A + XB × B + XC × C

   Y = M = YA × A + YB × B + YC × C
                       GR          GG           GB
   Z = N = ZA × A + ZB × B + ZC × C
In other words, the A, B, and C components are ﬁrst decoded individually by the
gamma functions. The results are treated as a three-element vector and multi-
plied by Matrix (a 3-by-3 matrix) to obtain the L, M, and N components of the
intermediate representation. Since there is no second stage, these are also the X, Y,
and Z components of the ﬁnal representation.

recommended D65 white point with 1.8 gammas and Sony Trinitron® phosphor
chromaticities.

In some cases, the parameters of a CalRGB color space may be speciﬁed in terms
of the CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates (xR , yR ), (xG , yG ), (xB , yB ) of the red,
green, and blue phosphors, respectively, and the chromaticity (xW , yW ) of the
diffuse white point corresponding to some linear RGB value (R, G, B), where
usually R = G = B = 1.0. Note that standard CIE notation uses lowercase letters to

Lab Color Spaces
A Lab color space is a CIE-based ABC color space with two transformation stages
(see Figure 4.14 on page 182). In a this type of space, A, B, and C represent the L*,
a*, and b* components of a CIE 1976 L*a*b* space. The range of the ﬁrst (L*)
component is always 0 to 100; the ranges of the second and third (a* and b*)
components are deﬁned by the Range entry in the color space dictionary (see
Table 4.15).
Plate 3 illustrates the coordinates of a typical Lab color space; Plate 4 compares
the gamuts (ranges of representable colors) for L*a*b*, RGB, and CMYK spaces.

           A Lab color space does not specify explicit decoding functions or matrix coef-

           (denoted by “Decode ABC,” “Matrix ABC,” “Decode LMN,” and “Matrix LMN” in
           Figure 4.14 on page 182). Instead, these parameters have constant implicit values.

ICCBased Color Spaces
ICCBased color spaces (PDF 1.3) are based on a cross-platform color proﬁle as
deﬁned by the International Color Consortium (ICC). Unlike the CalGray,
CalRGB, and Lab color spaces, which are characterized by entries in the color
space dictionary, an ICCBased color space is characterized by a sequence of bytes
in a standard format. Details of the proﬁle format can be found in the ICC speci-
ﬁcation (see the Bibliography).
An ICCBased color space is speciﬁed as an array:
   [/ICCBased stream]
          The stream contains the ICC proﬁle. Besides the usual entries common to all
          streams (see Table 3.4 on page 38), the proﬁle stream has the additional entries
          listed in Table 4.16.

          The ICC speciﬁcation is an evolving standard. The ICCBased color spaces
          supported in PDF 1.3 are based on ICC speciﬁcation version 3.3; those in PDF
          1.4 are based on the ICC speciﬁcation ICC.1:1998-09 and its addendum
          ICC.1A:1999-04. (Earlier versions of the ICC speciﬁcation are also supported.)
          This has the following consequences for producers and consumers of PDF:
          • A consumer that supports a given PDF version is required to support ICC pro-
             ﬁles conforming to the corresponding version (and earlier versions) of the ICC
             speciﬁcation, as described above. It may optionally support later ICC versions.
• For the most predictable and consistent results, a producer of a given PDF ver-
   sion should embed only proﬁles conforming to the corresponding version of
   the ICC speciﬁcation.
• A PDF producer may embed proﬁles conforming to a later ICC version, with
   the understanding that the results will vary depending on the capabilities of the
   consumer. The consumer might process the proﬁle while ignoring newer
   features, or it might fail altogether to process the proﬁle. In light of this, it is
   recommended that the producer provide an alternate color space (Alternate
   entry in the ICCBased color space dictionary) containing a proﬁle that is appro-
   priate for the PDF version.
As of version 1.4, PDF supports only the proﬁle types shown in Table 4.17; other
types may be supported in the future. (In particular, note that XYZ and 16-bit
L*a*b* proﬁles are not supported.) Each of the indicated ﬁelds must have one of
the values listed for that ﬁeld in the second column of the table. (Proﬁles must
satisfy both the criteria shown in the table.) The terminology is taken from the
ICC speciﬁcations.

The terminology used in PDF color spaces and ICC color proﬁles is similar, but
sometimes the same terms are used with different meanings. For example, the
default value for each component in an ICCBased color space is 0. The range of
each color component is a function of the color space speciﬁed by the proﬁle and
is indicated in the ICC speciﬁcation. The ranges for several ICC color spaces are
shown in Table 4.18.
                      TABLE 4.18 Ranges for typical ICC color spaces
ICC COLOR SPACE        COMPONENT RANGES
Gray                   [0.0 1.0]
RGB                    [0.0 1.0]
CMYK                   [0.0 1.0]
L*a*b*                 L*: [0 100]; a* and b*: [−128 127]
Since the ICCBased color space is being used as a source color space, only the “to
CIE” proﬁle information (AToB in ICC terminology) is used; the “from CIE”
(BToA) information is ignored when present. An ICC proﬁle may also specify a
rendering intent, but PDF viewer applications ignore this information; the ren-
dering intent is speciﬁed in PDF by a separate parameter (see “Rendering
Intents” on page 197).
Note: The requirements stated above apply to an ICCBased color space that is used
to specify the source colors of graphics objects. When such a space is used as the
blending color space for a transparency group in the transparent imaging model
(see Sections 7.2.3, “Blending Color Space”; 7.3, “Transparency Groups”; and 7.5.5,
“Transparency Group XObjects”), it must have both “to CIE” (AToB) and “from
CIE” (BToA) information. This is because the group color space is used as both the
destination for objects being painted within the group and the source for the group’s
results. ICC proﬁles are also used in specifying output intents for matching the
color characteristics of a PDF document with those of a target output device or pro-
duction environment. When used in this context, they are subject to still other con-
straints on the “to CIE” and “from CIE” information; see Section 9.10.4, “Output
Intents,” for details.
The representations of ICCBased color spaces are less compact than CalGray,
CalRGB, and Lab, but can represent a wider range of color spaces. In those cases
where a given color space can be expressed by more than one of the CIE-based
color space families, the resulting colors are expected to be rendered similarly,
regardless of the method selected for representation.
One particular color space is the so-called “standard RGB” or sRGB, deﬁned in
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) document Colour Measure-
ment and Management in Multimedia Systems and Equipment (see the Bibliogra-
phy). In PDF, the sRGB color space can be expressed precisely only as an
ICCBased space, although it can be approximated by a CalRGB space.
Example 4.9 shows an ICCBased color space for a typical three-component RGB
space. The proﬁle’s data has been encoded in hexadecimal representation for
readability; in actual practice, a lossless decompression ﬁlter such as FlateDecode
should be used.

Default Color Spaces
Specifying colors in a device color space (DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, or Device-
CMYK) makes them device-dependent. By setting default color spaces (PDF 1.1), a
PDF document can request that such colors be systematically transformed
(remapped) into device-independent CIE-based color spaces. This capability can
be useful in a variety of circumstances, such as the following:
• A document originally intended for one output device is redirected to a differ-
  ent device.
• A document is intended to be compatible with viewer applications designed for
  earlier versions of PDF, and thus cannot specify CIE-based colors directly.
• Color corrections or rendering intents need to be applied to device colors (see
  “Rendering Intents” on page 197).
A color space is selected for painting each graphics object. This is either the cur-
rent color space parameter in the graphics state or a color space given as an entry
in an image XObject, inline image, or shading dictionary. Regardless of how the
color space is speciﬁed, it may be subject to remapping as described below.
When a device color space is selected, the ColorSpace subdictionary of the cur-
rent resource dictionary (see Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries”) is checked
for the presence of an entry designating a corresponding default color space
(DefaultGray, DefaultRGB, or DefaultCMYK, corresponding to DeviceGray,
DeviceRGB, or DeviceCMYK, respectively). If such an entry is present, its value is
used as the color space for the operation currently being performed. (If the view-
er application does not recognize this color space, no remapping will occur; the
original device color space will be used.)
Color values in the original device color space are passed unchanged to the
default color space, which must have the same number of components as the
original space. The default color space should be chosen to be compatible with
the original, taking into account the components’ ranges and whether the com-
ponents are additive or subtractive. If a color value lies outside the range of the
default color space, it will be adjusted to the nearest valid value.
Note: Any color space other than a Lab, Indexed, or Pattern color space may be used
as a default color space, provided that it is compatible with the original device color
space as described above.
If the selected space is a special color space based on an underlying device color
space, the default color space will be used in place of the underlying space. This
applies to the following:
• The underlying color space of a Pattern color space
• The base color space of an Indexed color space
• The alternate color space of a Separation or DeviceN color space (but only if
   the alternate color space is actually selected)
See Section 4.5.5, “Special Color Spaces,” for details on these color spaces.
Note: Note that there is no conversion of color values, such as a tint transformation,
when using the default color space. Color values that are within the range of the
device color space might not be within the range of the default color space (particu-
larly if the default is an ICCBased color space). In this case, the nearest values within
the range of the default space will be used. For this reason, a Lab color space is not
permitted as the DefaultRGB color space.
Implicit Conversion of CIE-Based Color Spaces
In workﬂows in which PDF documents are intended for rendering on a speciﬁc
target output device (such as a printing press with particular inks and media), it
is often useful to specify the source colors for some or all of a document’s objects
in a CIE-based color space that matches the calibration of the intended device.
The resulting document, while tailored to the speciﬁc characteristics of the target
device, remains device-independent and will produce reasonable results if re-
targeted to a different output device. However, the expectation is that if the docu-
ment is printed on the intended target device, source colors that have been
speciﬁed in a color space matching the calibration of the device will pass through
unchanged, without conversion to and from the intermediate CIE 1931 XYZ
space as depicted in Figure 4.14 on page 182.
In particular, when colors intended for a CMYK output device are speciﬁed in an
ICCBased color space using a matching CMYK printing proﬁle, converting such
colors from four components to three and back is unnecessary and will result in
an undesirable loss of ﬁdelity in the black component. In such cases, PDF viewer
applications may provide the ability for the user to specify a particular calibration
to use for printing, prooﬁng, or previewing. This calibration is then considered
to be that of the native color space of the intended output device (typically
DeviceCMYK), and colors expressed in a CIE-based source color space matching
it can be treated as if they were speciﬁed directly in the device’s native color space.
Note that the conditions under which such implicit conversion is done cannot be
speciﬁed in PDF itself, since nothing in PDF describes the calibration of the out-
put device (although an output intent dictionary, if present, may suggest such a
calibration; see Section 9.10.4, “Output Intents”). The conversion is completely
hidden by the viewer application and plays no part in the interpretation of PDF
color spaces.
When this type of implicit conversion is done, all of the semantics of the device
color space should also apply, even though they do not apply to CIE-based spaces
in general. In particular:
• The nonzero overprint mode (see Section 4.5.6, “Overprint Control”) deter-
   mines the interpretation of color component values in the space.
• If the space is used as the blending color space for a transparency group in the
   transparent imaging model (see Sections 7.2.3, “Blending Color Space”; 7.3,
   “Transparency Groups”; and 7.5.5, “Transparency Group XObjects”), compo-
   nents of the space, such as Cyan, can be selected in a Separation or DeviceN
   color space used within the group (see “Separation Color Spaces” on page 201
   and “DeviceN Color Spaces” on page 205).
• Likewise, any uses of device color spaces for objects within such a transparency
   group have well-deﬁned conversions to the group color space.
Note: A source color space can be speciﬁed directly (for example, with an ICCBased
color space) or indirectly using the default color space mechanism (for example,
DefaultCMYK; see “Default Color Spaces” on page 194). The implicit conversion of a
CIE-based color space to a device space should not depend on whether the CIE-based
space is speciﬁed directly or indirectly.
Rendering Intents
Although CIE-based color speciﬁcations are theoretically device-independent,
they are subject to practical limitations in the color reproduction capabilities of
the output device. Such limitations may sometimes require compromises to be
made among various properties of a color speciﬁcation when rendering colors
for a given device. Specifying a rendering intent (PDF 1.1) allows a PDF ﬁle to set
priorities regarding which of these properties to preserve and which to sacriﬁce.
For example, the PDF ﬁle might request that colors falling within the output
device’s gamut (the range of colors it can reproduce) be rendered exactly while
sacriﬁcing the accuracy of out-of-gamut colors, or that a scanned image such as a
photograph be rendered in a perceptually “pleasing” manner at the cost of strict
colorimetric accuracy.
Rendering intents are speciﬁed with the ri operator (see Section 4.3.3, “Graphics
State Operators”) and with the Intent entry in image dictionaries (Section 4.8.4,
“Image Dictionaries”). The value is a name identifying the desired rendering
intent. Table 4.19 lists the standard rendering intents recognized in the initial
release of PDF viewer applications from Adobe Systems; Plate 5 illustrates their
effects. These intents have been deliberately chosen to correspond closely to those
deﬁned by the International Color Consortium (ICC), an industry organization
that has developed standards for device-independent color. Note, however, that
the exact set of rendering intents supported may vary from one output device to
another; a particular device may not support all possible intents, or may support
additional ones beyond those listed in the table. If the viewer application does not
recognize the speciﬁed name, it uses the RelativeColorimetric intent by default.
See Section 7.6.4, “Rendering Parameters and Transparency,” and in particular
“Rendering Intent and Color Conversions” on page 468, for further discussion of
the role of rendering intents in the transparent imaging model.
                         TABLE 4.19 Rendering intents
NAME                 DESCRIPTION
AbsoluteColorimetric Colors are represented solely with respect to the light source; no
                     correction is made for the output medium’s white point (such as
                     the color of unprinted paper). Thus, for example, a monitor’s
                     white point, which is bluish compared to that of a printer’s
                     paper, would be reproduced with a blue cast. In-gamut colors
                     are reproduced exactly; out-of-gamut colors are mapped to the
                     nearest value within the reproducible gamut. This style of
                     reproduction has the advantage of providing exact color
                     matches from one output medium to another. It has the
                     disadvantage of causing colors with Y values between the
                     medium’s white point and 1.0 to be out of gamut. A typical use
                     might be for logos and solid colors that require exact
                     reproduction across different media.
RelativeColorimetric Colors are represented with respect to the combination of the
                     light source and the output medium’s white point (such as the
                     color of unprinted paper). Thus, for example, a monitor’s white
                     point would be reproduced on a printer by simply leaving the
                     paper unmarked, ignoring color differences between the two
                     media. In-gamut colors are reproduced exactly; out-of-gamut
                     colors are mapped to the nearest value within the reproducible
                     gamut. This style of reproduction has the advantage of adapting
                     for the varying white points of different output media. It has the
                     disadvantage of not providing exact color matches from one
                     medium to another. A typical use might be for vector graphics.
Saturation           Colors are represented in a manner that preserves or emphasizes
                     saturation. Reproduction of in-gamut colors may or may not be
                     colorimetrically accurate. A typical use might be for business
                     graphics, where saturation is the most important attribute of the
                     color.
Perceptual           Colors are represented in a manner that provides a pleasing
                     perceptual appearance. This generally means that both in-gamut
                     and out-of-gamut colors are modiﬁed from their precise
                     colorimetric values in order to preserve color relationships. A
                     typical use might be for scanned images.
4.5.5 Special Color Spaces
      Special color spaces add features or properties to an underlying color space.
      There are four special color space families: Pattern, Indexed, Separation, and
      DeviceN.
      Pattern Color Spaces
      A Pattern color space (PDF 1.2) enables a PDF content stream to paint an area
      with a “color” deﬁned as a pattern, which may be either a tiling pattern (type 1) or
      a shading pattern (type 2). Section 4.6, “Patterns,” discusses patterns in detail.
      Indexed Color Spaces
      An Indexed color space allows a PDF content stream to select from a color map or
      color table of arbitrary colors in some other space, using small integers as indices.
      A PDF viewer application treats each sample value as an index into the color table
      and uses the color value it ﬁnds there. This technique can considerably reduce the
      amount of data required to represent a sampled image—for example, by using
      8-bit index values as samples instead of 24-bit RGB color values.
      An Indexed color space is deﬁned by a four-element array, as follows:
         [/Indexed base hival lookup]
      The ﬁrst element is the color space family name Indexed. The remaining ele-
      ments are parameters that an Indexed color space requires; their meanings are
      discussed below. Setting the current stroking or nonstroking color space to an
      Indexed color space initializes the corresponding current color to 0.
      The base parameter is an array or name that identiﬁes the base color space in
      which the values in the color table are to be interpreted. It can be any device or
      CIE-based color space or (in PDF 1.3) a Separation or DeviceN space, but not a
      Pattern space or another Indexed space. For example, if the base color space is
      DeviceRGB, the values in the color table are to be interpreted as red, green, and
      blue components; if the base color space is a CIE-based ABC space such as a
      CalRGB or Lab space, the values are to be interpreted as A, B, and C components.
Note: Attempting to use a Separation or DeviceN color space as the base for an
Indexed color space will generate an error in PDF 1.2.
The hival parameter is an integer that speciﬁes the maximum valid index value. In
other words, the color table is to be indexed by integers in the range 0 to hival.
hival can be no greater than 255, which is what would be required to index a table
with 8-bit index values.
The color table is deﬁned by the lookup parameter, which can be either a stream
or (in PDF 1.2) a string. It provides the mapping between index values and the
corresponding colors in the base color space.
The color table data must be m × (hival + 1) bytes long, where m is the number of
color components in the base color space. Each byte is an unsigned integer in the
range 0 to 255 that is scaled to the range of the corresponding color component
in the base color space; that is, 0 corresponds to the minimum value in the range
for that component, and 255 corresponds to the maximum.
Note: This is different from the interpretation of an Indexed color space’s color table
in PostScript. In PostScript, the component value is always scaled to the range 0.0 to
1.0, regardless of the range of color values in the base color space.
The color components for each entry in the table appear consecutively in the
string or stream. For example, if the base color space is DeviceRGB and the
indexed color space contains two colors, the order of bytes in the string or stream
is R0 G0 B0 R1 G1 B1 , where letters denote the color component and numeric
subscripts denote the table entry.
Example 4.10 illustrates the speciﬁcation of an Indexed color space that maps
8-bit index values to three-component color values in the DeviceRGB color space.
Example 4.10
    [ /Indexed
          /DeviceRGB
          255
          <000000 FF0000 00FF00 0000FF B57342 …>
    ]
The example shows only the ﬁrst ﬁve color values in the lookup string; in all, there
should be 256 color values and the string should be 768 bytes long. Having
established this color space, the program can now specify colors using single-
component values in the range 0 to 255. For example, a color value of 4 selects an
RGB color whose components are coded as the hexadecimal integers B5, 73, and
42. Dividing these by 255 and scaling the results to the range 0.0 to 1.0 yields a
color with red, green, and blue components of 0.710, 0.451, and 0.259, respec-
tively.
Although an Indexed color space is useful mainly for images, index values can
also be used with the color selection operators SC, SCN, sc, and scn. For example,
   123 sc
selects the same color as does an image sample value of 123. The index value
should be an integer in the range 0 to hival. If it is a real number, it is rounded to
the nearest integer; if it is outside the range 0 to hival, it is adjusted to the nearest
value within that range.
Separation Color Spaces
Color output devices produce full color by combining primary or process
colorants in varying amounts. On an additive color device such as a display, the
primary colorants consist of red, green, and blue phosphors; on a subtractive de-
vice such as a printer, they typically consist of cyan, magenta, yellow, and some-
times black inks. In addition, some devices can apply special colorants, often
called spot colorants, to produce effects that cannot be achieved with the standard
process colorants alone. Examples include metallic and ﬂuorescent colors and
special textures.
When printing a page, most devices produce a single composite page on which all
process colorants (and spot colorants, if any) are combined. However, some de-
vices, such as imagesetters, produce a separate, monochromatic rendition of the
page, called a separation, for each individual colorant. When the separations are
later combined—on a printing press, for example—and the proper inks or other
colorants are applied to them, a full-color page results.
A Separation color space (PDF 1.2) provides a means for specifying the use of
additional colorants or for isolating the control of individual color components
of a device color space for a subtractive device. When such a space is the current
color space, the current color is a single-component value, called a tint, that con-
trols the application of the given colorant or color components only.
Note: The term separation is often misused as a synonym for an individual device
colorant. In the context of this discussion, a printing system that produces separa-
tions generates a separate piece of physical medium (generally ﬁlm) for each color-
ant. It is these pieces of physical medium that are correctly referred to as separations.
A particular colorant properly constitutes a separation only if the device is generating
physical separations, one of which corresponds to the given colorant. The Separation
color space is so named for historical reasons, but it has evolved to the broader pur-
pose of controlling the application of individual colorants in general, whether or not
they are actually realized as physical separations.
Note also that the operation of a Separation color space itself is independent of the
characteristics of any particular output device. Depending on the device, the space
may or may not correspond to a true, physical separation or to an actual colorant.
For example, a Separation color space could be used to control the application of a
single process colorant (such as cyan) on a composite device that does not produce
physical separations, or could represent a color (such as orange) for which no speciﬁc
colorant exists on the device. A Separation color space provides consistent, predict-
able behavior, even on devices that cannot directly generate the requested color.
A Separation color space is deﬁned as follows:
    [/Separation name alternateSpace tintTransform]
In other words, it is a four-element array whose ﬁrst element is the color space
family name Separation. The remaining elements are parameters that a
Separation color space requires; their meanings are discussed below.
A color value in a Separation color space consists of a single tint component in
the range 0.0 to 1.0. The value 0.0 represents the minimum amount of colorant
that can be applied; 1.0 represents the maximum. Tints are always treated as
subtractive colors, even if the device produces output for the designated compo-
nent by an additive method. Thus a tint value of 0.0 denotes the lightest color
that can be achieved with the given colorant, and 1.0 the darkest. (Note that this
is the same as the convention for DeviceCMYK color components, but opposite to
the one for DeviceGray and DeviceRGB.) The SCN and scn operators respectively
set the current stroking and nonstroking color in the graphics state to a tint value;
the initial value in either case is 1.0. A sampled image with single-component
samples can also be used as a source of tint values.
The name parameter in the color space array is a name object specifying the
name of the colorant that this Separation color space is intended to represent (or
one of the special names All or None; see below). Such colorant names are arbi-
trary, and there can be any number of them, subject to implementation limits.
The special colorant name All refers collectively to all colorants available on an
output device, including those for the standard process colorants. When a
Separation space with this colorant name is the current color space, painting
operators apply tint values to all available colorants at once. This is useful for
purposes such as painting registration targets in the same place on every separa-
tion. Such marks would typically be painted as the last step in composing a page,
to ensure that they are not overwritten by subsequent painting operations.
The special colorant name None will never produce any visible output. Painting
operations in a Separation space with this colorant name have no effect on the
current page.
All devices support Separation color spaces with the colorant names All and
None, even if they do not support any others. Separation spaces with either of
these colorant names ignore the alternateSpace and tintTransform parameters (dis-
cussed below), although valid values must still be provided.
At the moment the color space is set to a Separation space, the viewer application
determines whether the device has an available colorant corresponding to the
name of the requested space. If so, the application ignores the alternateSpace and
tintTransform parameters; subsequent painting operations within the space will
apply the designated colorant directly, according to the tint values supplied.
Note: The preceding paragraph applies only to subtractive output devices such as
printers and imagesetters. For an additive device such as a computer display, a
Separation color space never applies a process colorant directly; it always reverts to
the alternate color space as described below. This is because the model of applying
process colorants independently does not work as intended on an additive device; for
instance, painting tints of the Red component on a white background produces a
result that varies from white to cyan.
Note that this exception applies only to colorants for additive devices, not to the spe-
ciﬁc names Red, Green, and Blue. In contrast, a printer might have a (subtractive)
ink named, say, Red, which should work as a Separation color space just the same as
any other supported colorant.
If the colorant name associated with a Separation color space does not cor-
respond to a colorant available on the device, the viewer application arranges
instead for subsequent painting operations to be performed in an alternate color
space. This enables the intended colors to be approximated by colors in some
device or CIE-based color space, which are then rendered using the usual pri-
mary or process colorants. This works as follows:
• The alternateSpace parameter must be an array or name object that identiﬁes
   the alternate color space. This can be any device or CIE-based color space, but
   not another special color space (Pattern, Indexed, Separation, or DeviceN).
• The tintTransform parameter must be a function (see Section 3.9, “Functions”).
   During subsequent painting operations, a viewer application will call this
   function to transform a tint value into color component values in the alternate
   color space. The function is called with the tint value and must return the cor-
   responding color component values. That is, the number of components and
   the interpretation of their values depend on the alternate color space.
Note: Painting in the alternate color space may produce a good approximation of the
intended color when only opaque objects are painted. However, it will not correctly
represent the interactions between an object and its backdrop when the object is
painted with transparency or when overprinting (see Section 4.5.6, “Overprint Con-
trol”) is enabled.
Example 4.11 illustrates the speciﬁcation of a Separation color space (object 5)
that is intended to produce a color named LogoGreen. If the output device has no
colorant corresponding to this color, DeviceCMYK will be used as the alternate
color space; the tint transformation function provided (object 12) maps tint
values linearly into shades of a CMYK color value approximating the “logo green”
color.

DeviceN Color Spaces
DeviceN color spaces (PDF 1.3) support the use of high-ﬁdelity and multitone
color. High-ﬁdelity color is the use of more than the standard CMYK process
colorants to produce an extended gamut, or range of colors. A popular example is
the PANTONE® Hexachrome™ system, which uses six colorants: the usual cyan,
magenta, yellow, and black, plus orange and green.
Multitone color systems use a single-component image to specify multiple color
components. In a duotone, for example, a single-component image can be used to
specify both the black component and a spot color component. The tone
reproduction is generally different for the different components; for example, the
black component might be painted with the exact sample data from the single-
component image, while the spot color component might be generated as a
nonlinear function of the image data in a manner that emphasizes the shadows.
Plate 6 shows an example using black and magenta color components. In Plate 7,
a single-component grayscale image is used to generate a quadtone result using
four colorants: black and three PANTONE spot colors. See Example 4.17 on page
212 for the code used to generate this image.
DeviceN color spaces allow any subset of the available device colorants to be
treated as a device color space with multiple components. This provides greater
ﬂexibility than is possible with standard device color spaces such as DeviceCMYK
or with individual Separation color spaces. For example, it is possible to create a
DeviceN color space consisting of only the cyan, magenta, and yellow color com-
ponents, while excluding the black component. If overprinting is enabled (see
Section 4.5.6, “Overprint Control”), painting in this color space will leave the
black component unchanged.
A DeviceN color space is speciﬁed as follows:
    [/DeviceN names alternateSpace tintTransform]
or
    [/DeviceN names alternateSpace tintTransform attributes]
It is a four- or ﬁve-element array whose ﬁrst element is the color space family
name DeviceN. The remaining elements are parameters that a DeviceN color
space requires; their meanings are discussed below.
Color values in the DeviceN color space are tint components in the range 0.0 to
1.0. The value 0.0 represents the minimum amount of colorant; 1.0 represents
the maximum. The SCN and scn operators respectively set the current stroking
and nonstroking color in the graphics state to a set of tint values; the initial value
is 1.0 for each tint. A sampled image can also be treated as a source of tint values.
A DeviceN color space works almost the same as a Separation color space—in
fact, a DeviceN color space with only one component is exactly equivalent to a
Separation color space. The following are the only differences between DeviceN
and Separation:
• Color values in a     DeviceN color space consist of multiple tint components,
   rather than only one. The number of components is subject to an implementa-
   tion limit; see Appendix C.
• The names parameter in the color space array is an array of name objects speci-
   fying the individual colorants. (The special colorant name All is not allowed.)
   The length of the array determines the number of components, and hence the
   number of operands required by the SCN and scn operators when this space is
   the current color space. Operand values supplied to SCN or scn are interpreted
   as color component values in the order in which the colors are given in the
   names array.
• At the moment the color space is set to a DeviceN space, the viewer application
   will select the requested set of colorants only if all of them are available on the
             device; otherwise, it will select the alternate color space designated by the
             alternateSpace parameter.
          • The tint transformation function is called with n tint values and must return
             the corresponding m color component values, where n is the number of com-
             ponents needed to specify a color in the DeviceN color space and m is the num-
             ber required by the alternate color space.
          In a DeviceN color space, one or more of the colorant names in the names array
          may be the name None. This indicates that the corresponding color component is
          never painted on the page, as in a Separation color space for the None colorant.
          When a DeviceN color space is painting the named device colorants directly,
          color components corresponding to None colorants are discarded. However,
          when the DeviceN color space reverts to its alternate color space, those com-
          ponents are passed to the tint transformation function, which may use them in
          any desired manner.
          Note: A DeviceN color space whose component colorant names are all None always
          discards its output, just the same as a Separation color space for None; it never
          reverts to the alternate color space. Reversion occurs only if at least one color com-
          ponent (other than None) is speciﬁed and is not available on the device.
          The optional attributes parameter is a dictionary containing additional informa-
          tion about the color space. At the time of publication, only one entry is deﬁned in
          this dictionary, as shown in Table 4.20.
                       TABLE 4.20 Entry in a DeviceN color space attributes dictionary

                                                                                                    the appearance that it produces. However, it provides information about the indi-

                                                                                                    nate color space and tint transformation function of a Separation color space

                                                                                                    space describe only the appearance of its colorants in combination.
Example 4.12 shows a DeviceN color space consisting of three color components
named Orange, Green, and None. In this example, the DeviceN color space,
object 30, has an attributes dictionary whose Colorants entry is an indirect refer-
ence to object 45 (which might also be referenced by attributes dictionaries of
other DeviceN color spaces). tintTransform1, whose deﬁnition is not shown, maps
three color components (tints of the colorants Orange, Green, and None) to four
color components in the alternate color space, DeviceCMYK. tintTransform2 maps
a single color component (an orange tint) to four components in DeviceCMYK.
Likewise, tintTransform3 maps a green tint to DeviceCMYK, and tintTransform4
maps a tint of PANTONE 131 to DeviceCMYK.

Multitone Examples
The following examples illustrate various interesting and useful special cases of
the use of Indexed and DeviceN color spaces in combination to produce multi-
tone colors.
Examples 4.13 and 4.14 illustrate the use of DeviceN to create duotone color
spaces. In Example 4.13, an Indexed color space maps index values in the range 0
to 255 to a duotone DeviceN space in cyan and black. In effect, the index values
are treated as if they were tints of the duotone space, which are then mapped into
tints of the two underlying colorants. Only the beginning of the lookup table
string for the Indexed color space is shown; the full table would contain 256 two-
byte entries, each specifying a tint value for cyan and black, for a total of 512
bytes. If the alternate color space of the DeviceN space is selected, the tint trans-
formation function (object 15 in the example) maps the two tint components for
cyan and black to the four components for a DeviceCMYK color space by supply-
ing zero values for the other two components. Example 4.14 shows the deﬁnition
of another duotone color space, this time using black and gold colorants (where
gold is a spot colorant) and using a CalRGB space as the alternate color space. This
could be deﬁned in the same way as in the preceding example, with a tint trans-
formation function that converts from the two tint components to colors in the
alternate CalRGB color space.

Given a formula for converting any combination of black and gold tints to cali-
brated RGB, a 2-in, 3-out type 4 (PostScript calculator) function could be used
for the tint transformation. Alternatively, a type 0 (sampled) function could be
used, but this would require a large number of sample points to represent the
function accurately; for example, sampling each input variable for 256 tint values
between 0.0 and 1.0 would require 256 2 = 65,536 samples. But since the DeviceN
color space is being used as the base of an Indexed color space, there are actually
only 256 possible combinations of black and gold tint values. A more compact
way to represent this information is to put the alternate color values directly into
the lookup table alongside the DeviceN color values, as in Example 4.15.
Example 4.15

       ]
   endobj
In this example, each entry in the lookup table has ﬁve components: two for
the black and gold colorants and three more (speciﬁed as None) for the equiva-
lent CalRGB color components. If the black and gold colorants are available on
the output device, the None components will be ignored; if black and gold are
not available, the tint transformation function will be used to convert a ﬁve-
component color into a three-component equivalent in the alternate CalRGB
color space. But since, by construction, the third, fourth, and ﬁfth components
are the CalRGB components, the tint transformation function can merely dis-
card the ﬁrst two components and return the last three. This can be easily ex-
pressed with a type 4 (PostScript calculator) function, as shown in Example
4.16.

      As in the preceding examples, an Indexed color space based on a DeviceN space is
      used to paint the grayscale image shown on the left in the plate with four color-
      ants: black and three PANTONE spot colors. The alternate color space is a simple
      calibrated RGB. Thus the DeviceN color space has seven components: the four
      desired colorants plus the three components of the alternate space. The example
      shows the image XObject (see Section 4.8.4, “Image Dictionaries”) representing
      the quadtone image, followed by the color space used to interpret the image data.
      (See implementation note 32 in Appendix H.)
4.5.6 Overprint Control
      The graphics state contains an overprint parameter, controlled by the OP and op
      entries in a graphics state parameter dictionary. Overprint control is useful main-
      ly on devices that produce true physical separations, but it is available on some
composite devices as well. Although the operation of this parameter is device-
dependent, it is described here, rather than in the chapter on color rendering,
because it pertains to an aspect of painting in device color spaces that is impor-
tant to many applications.
Any painting operation marks some speciﬁc set of device colorants, depending
on the color space in which the painting takes place. In a Separation or DeviceN
color space, the colorants to be marked are speciﬁed explicitly; in a device or CIE-
based color space, they are implied by the process color model of the output de-
vice (see Chapter 6). The overprint parameter is a boolean ﬂag that determines
how painting operations affect colorants other than those explicitly or implicitly
speciﬁed by the current color space.
If the overprint parameter is false (the default value), painting a color in any
color space causes the corresponding areas of unspeciﬁed colorants to be erased
(painted with a tint value of 0.0). The effect is that the color at any position on
the page is whatever was painted there last; this is consistent with the normal
painting behavior of the opaque imaging model.
If the overprint parameter is true and the output device supports overprinting,
no such erasing actions are performed; anything previously painted in other
colorants is left undisturbed. Consequently, the color at a given position on the
page may be a combined result of several painting operations in different color-
ants. The effect produced by such overprinting is device-dependent and is not
deﬁned by the PDF language.
Note: Not all devices support overprinting. Furthermore, many PostScript printers
support it only when separations are being produced, and not for composite output.
If overprinting is not supported, the value of the overprint parameter is ignored.
An additional graphics state parameter, the overprint mode (PDF 1.3), affects the
interpretation of a tint value of 0.0 for a color component in a DeviceCMYK color
space when overprinting is enabled. This parameter is controlled by the OPM
entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary; it has an effect only when the
overprint parameter is true, as described above.
When colors are speciﬁed in a DeviceCMYK color space and the native color space
of the output device is also DeviceCMYK, each of the source color components
controls the corresponding device colorant directly. Ordinarily, each source color
component value replaces the value previously painted for the corresponding de-
vice colorant, no matter what the new value is; this is the default behavior, speci-
ﬁed by overprint mode 0.
When the overprint mode is 1 (also called nonzero overprint mode), a tint value of
0.0 for a source color component leaves the corresponding component of the
previously painted color unchanged. The effect is equivalent to painting in a
DeviceN color space that includes only those components whose values are non-
zero. For example, if the overprint parameter is true and the overprint mode is 1,
the operation
    0.2 0.3 0.0 1.0 k
is equivalent to
    0.2 0.3 1.0 scn
in the color space shown in Example 4.18.

Nonzero overprint mode applies only to painting operations that use the current
color in the graphics state when the current color space is DeviceCMYK. It does
not apply to the painting of images or to any colors that are the result of a com-
putation, such as those in a shading pattern or conversions from some other
         color space. It also does not apply if the device’s native color space is not Device-
         CMYK; in that case, source colors must be converted to the device’s native color
         space, and all components participate in the conversion, whatever their values.
         (This is shown explicitly in the alternate color space and tint transformation
         function of the DeviceN color space in Example 4.18.)
         See Section 7.6.3, “Overprinting and Transparency,” for further discussion of the
         role of overprinting in the transparent imaging model.
  4.5.7 Color Operators
         Table 4.21 lists the PDF operators that control color spaces and color values. (Also
         color-related is the graphics state operator ri, listed in Table 4.7 on page 156 and
         discussed under “Rendering Intents” on page 197.) Color operators may appear
         at the page description level or inside text objects (see Figure 4.1 on page 135).

                              and name must be a name object. If the color space is one that can be speciﬁed
                              by a name and no additional parameters (DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK,
                              and certain cases of Pattern), the name may be speciﬁed directly. Otherwise, it
                              must be a name deﬁned in the ColorSpace subdictionary of the current resource
                              dictionary (see Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries”); the associated value is an
                              array describing the color space (see Section 4.5.2, “Color Space Families”).
                              Note: The names DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, and Pattern always iden-
                              tify the corresponding color spaces directly; they never refer to resources in the Color-
                              Space subdictionary.
                              The CS operator also sets the current stroking color to its initial value, which de-
                              pends on the color space:
                              •  In a DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, CalGray, or CalRGB color space, the initial color
                                 has all components equal to 0.0.
                              •  In a DeviceCMYK color space, the initial color is [0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0].
                              •  In a Lab or ICCBased color space, the initial color has all components equal to
                                 0.0 unless that falls outside the intervals speciﬁed by the space’s Range entry,
                                 in which case the nearest valid value is substituted.
                              •  In an Indexed color space, the initial color value is 0.
              •  In a Separation or DeviceN color space, the initial tint value is 1.0 for all color-

        In certain circumstances, invoking operators that specify colors or other color-
        related parameters in the graphics state is not allowed. This restriction occurs
        when deﬁning graphical ﬁgures whose colors are to be speciﬁed separately each
        time they are used. Speciﬁcally, the restriction applies:
        • In any glyph description that uses the d1 operator (see Section 5.5.4, “Type 3
          Fonts”)
        • In the content stream of an uncolored tiling pattern (see “Uncolored Tiling
          Patterns” on page 227)
        In these circumstances, the following will cause an error:
        • Invoking any of the following operators:

        • Painting an image. However, painting an image mask (see “Stencil Masking” on
          page 276) is permitted, because it does not specify colors, but rather designates
          places where the current color is to be painted.
4.6 Patterns
    When operators such as S (stroke), f (ﬁll), and Tj (show text) paint an area of the
    page with the current color, they ordinarily apply a single color that covers the
    area uniformly. However, it is also possible to apply “paint” that consists of a re-
    peating graphical ﬁgure or a smoothly varying color gradient instead of a simple
    color. Such a repeating ﬁgure or smooth gradient is called a pattern. Patterns are
    quite general, and have many uses; for example, they can be used to create vari-
    ous graphical textures, such as weaves, brick walls, sunbursts, and similar geo-
    metrical and chromatic effects. (See implementation note 33 in Appendix H.)
    Patterns come in two varieties:
    • Tiling patterns consist of a small graphical ﬁgure (called a pattern cell) that is
       replicated at ﬁxed horizontal and vertical intervals to ﬁll the area to be painted.
       The graphics objects to use for tiling are described by a content stream.
    • Shading patterns deﬁne a gradient ﬁll that produces a smooth transition
       between colors across the area. The color to use is speciﬁed as a function of
       position using any of a variety of methods.
    Note: The ability to paint with patterns is a feature of PDF 1.2 (tiling patterns) and
    PDF 1.3 (shading patterns). With some effort, it is possible to achieve a limited form
    of tiling patterns in PDF 1.1 by deﬁning them as character glyphs in a special font
    and painting them repeatedly with the Tj operator. Another technique, deﬁning
    patterns as halftone screens, is not recommended, because the effects produced are
    device-dependent.
    Patterns are speciﬁed in a special family of color spaces named Pattern, whose
    “color values” are pattern objects instead of the numeric component values used
    with other spaces. A pattern object may be a dictionary or a stream, depending
    on the type of pattern; the term pattern dictionary is used generically throughout
    this section to refer to either a dictionary object or the dictionary portion of a
    stream object. (Those pattern objects that are streams are speciﬁcally identiﬁed as
    such in the descriptions of particular pattern types; unless otherwise stated, they
    are understood to be simple dictionaries instead.) This section describes Pattern
    color spaces and the speciﬁcation of color values within them; see Section 4.5,
    “Color Spaces,” for information about color spaces and color values in general,
    and Section 7.5.6, “Patterns and Transparency,” for further discussion of the
    treatment of patterns in the transparent imaging model.
4.6.1 General Properties of Patterns
      A pattern dictionary contains descriptive information deﬁning the appearance
      and properties of a pattern. All pattern dictionaries contain an entry named
      PatternType, whose value identiﬁes the kind of pattern the dictionary describes:
      type 1 for a tiling pattern or type 2 for a shading pattern. The remaining contents
      of the dictionary depend on the pattern type, and are detailed below in the sec-
      tions on individual pattern types.
      All patterns are treated as colors; a Pattern color space is established with the CS
      or cs operator just like other color spaces, and a particular pattern is installed as
      the current color with the SCN or scn operator (see Table 4.21 on page 216).
      A pattern’s appearance is described with respect to its own internal coordinate
      system. Every pattern has a pattern matrix, a transformation matrix that maps the
      pattern’s internal coordinate system to the default coordinate system of the pat-
      tern’s parent content stream (the content stream in which the pattern is deﬁned as
      a resource). The concatenation of the pattern matrix with that of the parent con-
      tent stream establishes the pattern coordinate space, within which all graphics ob-
      jects in the pattern are interpreted.
      For example, if a pattern is used on a page, the pattern will appear in the Pattern
      subdictionary of that page’s resource dictionary, and the pattern matrix maps
      pattern space to the default (initial) coordinate space of the page. Changes to the
      page’s transformation matrix that occur within the page’s content stream, such as
      rotation and scaling, have no effect on the pattern; it maintains its original rela-
      tionship to the page no matter where on the page it is used. Similarly, if a pattern
      is used within a form XObject (see Section 4.9, “Form XObjects”), the pattern
      matrix maps pattern space to the form’s default user space (that is, the form co-
      ordinate space at the time the form is painted with the Do operator). Finally, a
      pattern may used within another pattern; the inner pattern’s matrix deﬁnes its
      relationship to the pattern space of the outer pattern.
      Note: PostScript allows a pattern to be deﬁned in one context but used in another.
      For example, a pattern might be deﬁned on a page (that is, its pattern matrix maps
      the pattern coordinate space to the user space of the page) but be used in a form on
      that page, so that its relationship to the page is independent of each individual place-
      ment of the form. PDF does not support this feature; in PDF, all patterns are local to
      the context in which they are deﬁned.
  4.6.2 Tiling Patterns
          A tiling pattern consists of a small graphical ﬁgure called a pattern cell. Painting
          with the pattern replicates the cell at ﬁxed horizontal and vertical intervals to ﬁll
          an area. The effect is as if the ﬁgure were painted on the surface of a clear glass
          tile, identical copies of which were then laid down in an array covering the area
          and trimmed to its boundaries. This is called tiling the area.
          The pattern cell can include graphical elements such as ﬁlled areas, text, and sam-
          pled images. Its shape need not be rectangular, and the spacing of tiles can differ
          from the dimensions of the cell itself. When performing painting operations such
          as S (stroke) or f (ﬁll), the viewer application paints the cell on the current page
          as many times as necessary to ﬁll an area. The order in which individual tiles
          (instances of the cell) are painted is unspeciﬁed and unpredictable; it is inad-
          visable for the ﬁgures on adjacent tiles to overlap.
          The appearance of the pattern cell is deﬁned by a content stream containing the
          painting operators needed to paint one instance of the cell. Besides the usual en-
          tries common to all streams (see Table 3.4 on page 38), this stream’s dictionary
          has the additional entries listed in Table 4.22.

The pattern dictionary’s BBox, XStep, and YStep values are interpreted in the pat-
tern coordinate system, and the graphics objects in the pattern’s content stream
are deﬁned with respect to that coordinate system. The placement of pattern cells
in the tiling is based on the location of one key pattern cell, which is then dis-
placed by multiples of XStep and YStep to replicate the pattern. The origin of the
key pattern cell coincides with the origin of the pattern coordinate system; the
phase of the tiling can be controlled by the translation components of the Matrix
entry in the pattern dictionary.
The ﬁrst step in painting with a tiling pattern is to establish the pattern as the cur-
rent color in the graphics state. Subsequent painting operations will tile the
painted areas with the pattern cell described by the pattern’s content stream.
Whenever it needs to obtain the pattern cell, the viewer application does the fol-
lowing:
1. Saves the current graphics state (as if by invoking the q operator)
2. Installs the graphics state that was in effect at the beginning of the pattern’s
   parent content stream, with the current transformation matrix altered by the
   pattern matrix as described in Section 4.6.1, “General Properties of Patterns”
3. Paints the graphics objects speciﬁed in the pattern’s content stream
4. Restores the saved graphics state (as if by invoking the Q operator)
Note: The pattern’s content stream should not set any of the device-dependent
parameters in the graphics state (see Table 4.3 on page 150). Doing so may result in
incorrect output.
Colored Tiling Patterns
A colored tiling pattern is one whose color is self-contained. In the course of
painting the pattern cell, the pattern’s content stream explicitly sets the color of
each graphical element it paints. A single pattern cell can contain elements that
are painted different colors; it can also contain sampled grayscale or color images.
This type of pattern is identiﬁed by a pattern type of 1 and a paint type of 1 in the
pattern dictionary.
When the current color space is a Pattern space, a colored tiling pattern can be
selected as the current color by supplying its name as the single operand to the
SCN or scn operator. This name must be the key of an entry in the Pattern sub-
dictionary of the current resource dictionary (see Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dic-
tionaries”), whose value is the stream object representing the pattern. Since the
pattern deﬁnes its own color information, no additional operands representing
color components are speciﬁed to SCN or scn. For example, if P1 is the name of a
pattern resource in the current resource dictionary, the following code establishes
it as the current nonstroking color:
    /Pattern cs
    /P1 scn
Subsequent executions of nonstroking painting operators, such as f (ﬁll), Tj
(show text), or Do (paint external object) with an image mask, will use the desig-
nated pattern to tile the areas to be painted.
Example 4.19 deﬁnes a page (object 5) that paints three circles and a triangle
using a colored tiling pattern (object 15) over a yellow background. The pattern
consists of the symbols for the four suits of playing cards (spades, hearts, dia-
monds, and clubs), which are character glyphs taken from the ZapfDingbats font
(see Section D.4, “ZapfDingbats Set and Encoding”); the pattern’s content stream
speciﬁes the color of each glyph. Plate 8 shows the results.

Several features of Example 4.19 are noteworthy:
• The three circles and the triangle are painted with the same pattern. The pat-
   tern cells align, even though the circles and triangle are not aligned with respect
   to the pattern cell. For example, the position of the blue diamonds varies rela-
   tive to the three circles.
• The pattern cell does not completely cover the tile: it leaves the spaces between
   the glyphs unpainted. When the tiling pattern is used as a color, the existing
   background (the yellow rectangle) shows through these unpainted areas.
Uncolored Tiling Patterns
An uncolored tiling pattern is one that has no inherent color: the color must be
speciﬁed separately whenever the pattern is used. This type of pattern is iden-
tiﬁed by a pattern type of 1 and a paint type of 2 in the pattern dictionary. The
pattern’s content stream does not explicitly specify any colors; it can paint an
image mask (see “Stencil Masking” on page 276), but no other kind of image.
This provides a way to tile different regions of the page with pattern cells having
the same shape but different colors.
A Pattern color space representing an uncolored tiling pattern requires a parame-
ter: an object identifying the underlying color space in which the actual color of
the pattern is to be speciﬁed. The underlying color space is given as the second
element of the array that deﬁnes the Pattern color space. For example, the array
    [/Pattern /DeviceRGB]
deﬁnes a Pattern color space with DeviceRGB as its underlying color space.
Note: The underlying color space cannot be another Pattern color space.
Operands supplied to the SCN or scn operator in such a color space must include
a color value in the underlying color space, speciﬁed by one or more numeric
color components, as well as the name of a pattern object representing an un-
colored tiling pattern. For example, if the current resource dictionary (see Sec-
tion 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries”) deﬁnes Cs3 as the name of a ColorSpace
resource whose value is the Pattern color space shown above, and P2 as a Pattern
resource denoting an uncolored tiling pattern, then the code
   /Cs3 cs
   0.30 0.75 0.21 /P2 scn
establishes Cs3 as the current nonstroking color space and P2 as the current non-
stroking color, to be painted in the color represented by the speciﬁed components
in the DeviceRGB color space. Subsequent executions of nonstroking painting
operators, such as f (ﬁll), Tj (show text), and Do (paint external object) with an
image mask, will use the designated pattern and color to tile the areas to be paint-
ed. The same pattern can be used repeatedly with a different color each time.
Example 4.20 is similar to Example 4.19 on page 224, except that it uses an uncol-
ored tiling pattern to paint the three circles and the triangle, each in a different
color (see Plate 9). To do so, it supplies four operands each time it invokes the scn
operator: three numbers denoting the components of the desired color in the
underlying DeviceRGB color space, along with the name of the pattern.

  4.6.3 Shading Patterns
          Shading patterns (PDF 1.3) provide a smooth transition between colors across an
          area to be painted, independent of the resolution of any particular output device
          and without specifying the number of steps in the color transition. Patterns of
          this type are described by pattern dictionaries with a pattern type of 2. Table 4.23
          shows the contents of this type of dictionary.

          The most signiﬁcant entry is Shading, whose value is a shading object deﬁning the
          properties of the shading pattern’s gradient ﬁll. This is a complex “paint” that de-
          termines the type of color transition the shading pattern produces when painted
          across an area. A shading object may be a dictionary or a stream, depending on
          the type of shading; the term shading dictionary is used generically throughout
          this section to refer to either a dictionary object or the dictionary portion of a
          stream object. (Those shading objects that are streams are speciﬁcally identiﬁed
          as such in the descriptions of particular shading types; unless otherwise stated,
          they are understood to be simple dictionaries instead.)
         By setting a shading pattern as the current color in the graphics state, a PDF con-
         tent stream can use it with painting operators such as f (ﬁll), S (stroke), Tj (show
         text), or Do (paint external object) with an image mask to paint a path, character
         glyph, or mask with a smooth color transition. When a shading is used in this
         way, the geometry of the gradient ﬁll is independent of that of the object being
         painted.
         Shading Operator
         When the area to be painted is a relatively simple shape whose geometry is the
         same as that of the gradient ﬁll itself, the sh operator can be used instead of the
         usual painting operators. sh accepts a shading dictionary as an operand and
         applies the corresponding gradient ﬁll directly to current user space. This opera-
         tor does not require the creation of a pattern dictionary or a path and works
         without reference to the current color in the graphics state. Table 4.24 describes
         the sh operator.
         Note: Patterns deﬁned by type 2 pattern dictionaries do not tile. To create a tiling
         pattern containing a gradient ﬁll, invoke the sh operator from within the content
         stream of a type 1 (tiling) pattern.

                          ject to the current clipping path. The current color in the graphics state is neither
                          used nor altered. The effect is different from that of painting a path using a shading
                          pattern as the current color.
                          name is the name of a shading dictionary resource in the Shading subdictionary of
                          the current resource dictionary (see Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries”). All co-
                          ordinates in the shading dictionary are interpreted relative to the current user
                          space. (By contrast, when a shading dictionary is used in a type 2 pattern, the
                          coordinates are expressed in pattern space.) All colors are interpreted in the color
                          space identiﬁed by the shading dictionary’s ColorSpace entry (see Table 4.25 on
                          page 234). The Background entry, if present, is ignored.
                          This operator should be applied only to bounded or geometrically deﬁned shad-
                          ings. If applied to an unbounded shading, it will paint the shading’s gradient ﬁll
                          across the entire clipping region, which may be time-consuming.
Shading Dictionaries
A shading dictionary speciﬁes details of a particular gradient ﬁll, including the
type of shading to be used, the geometry of the area to be shaded, and the geom-
etry of the gradient ﬁll itself. Various shading types are available, depending on
the value of the dictionary’s ShadingType entry:
• Function-based shadings (type 1) deﬁne the color of every point in the domain
  using a mathematical function (not necessarily smooth or continuous).
• Axial shadings (type 2) deﬁne a color blend along a line between two points,
  optionally extended beyond the boundary points by continuing the boundary
  colors.
• Radial shadings (type 3) deﬁne a blend between two circles, optionally ex-
  tended beyond the boundary circles by continuing the boundary colors. This
  type of shading is commonly used to represent three-dimensional spheres and
  cones.
• Free-form Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes (type 4) deﬁne a common construct
  used by many three-dimensional applications to represent complex colored
  and shaded shapes. Vertices are speciﬁed in free-form geometry.
• Lattice-form Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes (type 5) are based on the same
  geometrical construct as type 4, but with vertices speciﬁed as a pseudo-
  rectangular lattice.
• Coons patch meshes (type 6) construct a shading from one or more color
  patches, each bounded by four cubic Bézier curves.
• Tensor-product patch meshes (type 7) are similar to type 6, but with additional
  control points in each patch, affording greater control over color mapping.
Table 4.25 shows the entries that all shading dictionaries share in common;
entries speciﬁc to particular shading types are described in the relevant sections
below.
Note: The term target coordinate space, used in many of the following descriptions,
refers to the coordinate space into which a shading is painted. For shadings used with
a type 2 pattern dictionary, this is the pattern coordinate space, discussed in Section
4.6.1, “General Properties of Patterns.” For shadings used directly with the sh opera-
tor, it is the current user space.

Shading types 4 to 7 are deﬁned by a stream containing descriptive data charac-
terizing the shading’s gradient ﬁll. In these cases, the shading dictionary is also a
stream dictionary and can contain any of the standard entries common to all
streams (see Table 3.4 on page 38). In particular, it will always include a Length
entry, which is required for all streams.
In addition, some shading dictionaries also include a Function entry whose value
is a function object (dictionary or stream) deﬁning how colors vary across the
area to be shaded. In such cases, the shading dictionary usually deﬁnes the geom-
etry of the shading, while the function deﬁnes the color transitions across that
geometry. The function is required for some types of shading and optional for
others. Functions are described in detail in Section 3.9, “Functions.”
Note: Discontinuous color transitions, or those with high spatial frequency, may ex-
hibit aliasing effects when painted at low effective resolutions.
Color Space: Special Considerations
Conceptually, a shading determines a color value for each individual point within
the area to be painted. In practice, however, the shading may actually be used to
compute color values only for some subset of the points in the target area, with
the colors of the intervening points determined by interpolation between the
ones computed. Viewer applications are free to use this strategy as long as the
interpolated color values approximate those deﬁned by the shading to within the
smoothness tolerance speciﬁed in the graphics state (see Section 6.5.2, “Smooth-
ness Tolerance”). The ColorSpace entry common to all shading dictionaries not
only deﬁnes the color space in which the shading speciﬁes its color values, but
also determines the color space in which color interpolation is performed.
Note: Some shading types (4 to 7) perform interpolation on a parametric value sup-
plied as input to the shading’s color function, as described in the relevant sections
below. This form of interpolation is conceptually distinct from the interpolation
described here, which operates on the output color values produced by the color
function and takes place within the shading’s target color space.
Gradient ﬁlls between colors deﬁned by most shadings are implemented using a
variety of interpolation algorithms, and these algorithms are sensitive to the
characteristics of the color space. Linear interpolation, for example, may have ob-
servably different results when applied in a DeviceCMYK color space than in a Lab
color space, even if the starting and ending colors are perceptually identical. The
difference arises because the two color spaces are not linear relative to each other.
Shadings are rendered according to the following rules:
• If ColorSpace is a device color space different from the native color space of the
  output device, color values in the shading will be converted to the native color
  space using the standard conversion formulas described in Section 6.2, “Con-
  versions among Device Color Spaces.” To optimize performance, these conver-
  sions may take place at any time (either before or after any interpolation on the
  color values in the shading). Thus, shadings deﬁned with device color spaces
  may have color gradient ﬁlls that are less accurate and somewhat device-
  dependent. (This does not apply to axial and radial shadings—shading types 2
  and 3—because those shading types perform gradient ﬁll calculations on a
  single variable and then convert to parametric colors.)
• If ColorSpace is a CIE-based color space, all gradient ﬁll calculations will be
  performed in that space. Conversion to device colors will occur only after all
  interpolation calculations have been performed. Thus, the color gradients will
  be device-independent for the colors generated at each point.
• If ColorSpace is a Separation or DeviceN color space and the speciﬁed color-
  ants are supported, no color conversion calculations are needed. If the speciﬁed
  colorants are not supported (so that the space’s alternate color space must be
  used), gradient ﬁll calculations will be performed in the designated Separation
  or DeviceN color space before conversion to the alternate space. Thus, non-
  linear tint transformation functions will be accommodated for the best possi-
  ble representation of the shading.
• If ColorSpace is an Indexed color space, all color values speciﬁed in the shading
  will be immediately converted to the base color space. Depending on whether
  the base color space is a device or CIE-based space, gradient ﬁll calculations
  will be performed as stated above. Interpolation never occurs in an Indexed
  color space, which is quantized and therefore inappropriate for calculations
  that assume a continuous range of colors. For similar reasons, an Indexed color
  space is not allowed in any shading whose color values are generated by a func-
  tion; this applies to any shading dictionary that contains a Function entry.
Shading Types
In addition to the entries listed in Table 4.25 on page 234, all shading dictionaries
have entries speciﬁc to the type of shading they represent, as indicated by the
         value of their ShadingType entry. The following sections describe the available
         shading types and the dictionary entries speciﬁc to each.
         Type 1 (Function-Based) Shadings
         In type 1 (function-based) shadings, the color at every point in the domain is
         deﬁned by a speciﬁed mathematical function. The function need not be smooth

         ful for shadings that cannot be adequately described with any of the other types.

                                                                                                    the value returned by the function for a given color component is out of range, it

         The domain rectangle (Domain) establishes an internal coordinate space for the
         shading that is independent of the target coordinate space in which it is to be
         painted. The color function(s) (Function) specify the color of the shading at each
         point within this domain rectangle. The transformation matrix (Matrix) then
         maps the domain rectangle into a corresponding rectangle or parallelogram in
         the target coordinate space. Points within the shading’s bounding box (BBox)
         that fall outside this transformed domain rectangle will be painted with the shad-
         ing’s background color (Background); if the shading dictionary has no
         Background entry, such points will be left unpainted. If the function is undeﬁned
         at any point within the declared domain rectangle, an error may occur, even if the
         corresponding transformed point falls outside the shading’s bounding box.
         Type 2 (Axial) Shadings
         Type 2 (axial) shadings deﬁne a color blend that varies along a linear axis between
         two endpoints and extends indeﬁnitely perpendicular to that axis. The shading
         may optionally be extended beyond either or both endpoints by continuing the
         boundary colors indeﬁnitely. Table 4.27 shows the shading dictionary entries spe-
         ciﬁc to this type of shading, in addition to those common to all shading diction-
         aries (Table 4.25 on page 234).

                                                                                                    value: [false false].
The color blend is accomplished by linearly mapping each point (x, y) along the
axis between the endpoints (x0 , y0 ) and (x1 , y1 ) to a corresponding point in the
domain speciﬁed by the shading dictionary’s Domain entry. The points (0, 0) and
(1, 0) in the domain correspond respectively to (x0 , y0 ) and (x1 , y1 ) on the axis.
Since all points along a line in domain space perpendicular to the line from (0, 0)
to (1, 0) will have the same color, only the new value of x needs to be computed:
           ( x1 – x0 ) × ( x – x0 ) + ( y1 – y0 ) × ( y – y0 )
    x′ = ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                                           -
                               ( x1 – x0 )2 + ( y1 – y0 )2
The value of the parametric variable t is then determined from x′ as follows:
• For 0 ≤ x′ ≤ 1, t = t0 + (t1 − t0 ) × x′.
• For x′ < 0, if the ﬁrst element of the Extend array is true, then t = t0 ; otherwise,
   t is undeﬁned and the point is left unpainted.
• For x′ > 1, if the second element of the Extend array is true, then t = t1 ; other-
   wise, t is undeﬁned and the point is left unpainted.
The resulting value of t is then passed as input to the function(s) deﬁned by the
shading dictionary’s Function entry, yielding the component values of the color
with which to paint the point (x, y).
Plate 10 shows three examples of the use of an axial shading to ﬁll a rectangle and
display text. The area to be ﬁlled extends beyond the shading’s bounding box.
The shading is the same in all three cases, except for the values of the Background
and Extend entries in the shading dictionary. In the ﬁrst example, the shading is
not extended at either end and no background color is speciﬁed, so the shading is
clipped to its bounding box at both ends. The second example still has no back-
ground color speciﬁed, but the shading is extended at both ends; the result is to
ﬁll the remaining portions of the ﬁlled area with the colors deﬁned at the ends of
the shading. In the third example, the shading is extended at both ends and a
background color is speciﬁed, so the background color is used for the portions of
the ﬁlled area beyond the ends of the shading.
Type 3 (Radial) Shadings
Type 3 (radial) shadings deﬁne a color blend that varies between two circles.
Shadings of this type are commonly used to depict three-dimensional spheres
and cones. Table 4.28 shows the shading dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of
         shading, in addition to those common to all shading dictionaries (Table 4.25 on
         page 234).

         The color blend is based on a family of blend circles interpolated between the
         starting and ending circles that are deﬁned by the shading dictionary’s Coords
         entry. The blend circles are deﬁned in terms of a subsidiary parametric variable
                   t – t0
            s = --------------
                  t1 – t0
which varies linearly between 0.0 and 1.0 as t varies across the domain from t0 to
t1 , as speciﬁed by the dictionary’s Domain entry. The center and radius of each
blend circle are given by the parametric equations
    x c(s) = x 0 + s × ( x 1 – x 0 )
     y c(s) = y 0 + s × ( y 1 – y 0 )
      r(s) = r 0 + s × ( r 1 – r 0 )
Each value of s between 0.0 and 1.0 determines a corresponding value of t, which
is then passed as the input argument to the function(s) deﬁned by the shading
dictionary’s Function entry. This yields the component values of the color with
which to ﬁll the corresponding blend circle. For values of s not lying between 0.0
and 1.0, the boolean elements of the shading dictionary’s Extend array determine
whether and how the shading will be extended. If the ﬁrst of the two elements is
true, the shading is extended beyond the deﬁned starting circle to values of s less
than 0.0; if the second element is true, the shading is extended beyond the de-
ﬁned ending circle to s values greater than 1.0.
Note that either of the starting and ending circles may be larger than the other. If
the shading is extended at the smaller end, the family of blend circles continues as
far as that value of s for which the radius of the blend circle r(s) = 0; if the shading
is extended at the larger end, the blend circles continue as far as that s value for
which r(s) is large enough to encompass the shading’s entire bounding box
(BBox). Extending the shading can thus cause painting to extend beyond the
areas deﬁned by the two circles themselves. The two examples in the rightmost
column of Plate 11 depict the results of extending the shading at the smaller and
larger ends, respectively.
Conceptually, all of the blend circles are painted in order of increasing values of s,
from smallest to largest. Blend circles extending beyond the starting circle are
painted in the same color deﬁned by the shading dictionary’s Function entry for
the starting circle (t = t0 , s = 0.0); those extending beyond the ending circle are
painted in the color deﬁned for the ending circle (t = t1 , s = 1.0). The painting is
opaque, with the color of each circle completely overlaying those preceding it;
thus if a point lies within more than one blend circle, its ﬁnal color will be that of
the last of the enclosing circles to be painted, corresponding to the greatest value
of s. Note the following points:
• If one of the starting and ending circles entirely contains the other, the shading
   will depict a sphere, as in Plates 12 and 13. In Plate 12, the inner circle has zero
  radius; it is the starting circle in the ﬁgure on the left and the ending circle in
  the one on the right. Neither shading is extended at either the smaller or larger
  end. In Plate 13, the inner circle in both ﬁgures has a nonzero radius and the
  shading is extended at the larger end. In each plate, a background color is
  speciﬁed for the ﬁgure on the right, but not for the one on the left.
• If neither circle contains the other, the shading will depict a cone. If the starting
  circle is larger, the cone will appear to point out of the page; if the ending circle
  is larger, the cone will appear to point into the page (see Plate 11).
Example 4.21 paints the leaf-covered branch shown in Plate 14. Each leaf is ﬁlled
with the same radial shading (object number 5). The color function (object 10) is
a stitching function (described in Section 3.9.3, “Type 3 (Stitching) Functions”)
whose two subfunctions (objects 11 and 12) are both exponential interpolation
functions (see Section 3.9.2, “Type 2 (Exponential Interpolation) Functions”).
Each leaf is drawn as a path and then ﬁlled with the shading, using code such as
that shown in Example 4.22 (where the name Sh1 is associated with object 5 by
the Shading subdictionary of the current resource dictionary; see Section 3.7.2,
“Resource Dictionaries”).

Type 4 Shadings (Free-Form Gouraud-Shaded Triangle Meshes)
Type 4 shadings (free-form Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes) are commonly
used to represent complex colored and shaded three-dimensional shapes. The
area to be shaded is deﬁned by a path composed entirely of triangles. The color at
each vertex of the triangles is speciﬁed, and a technique known as Gouraud
interpolation is used to color the interiors. The interpolation functions deﬁning
the shading may be linear or nonlinear. Table 4.29 shows the entries speciﬁc to
this type of shading dictionary, in addition to those common to all shading dic-
tionaries (Table 4.25 on page 234) and stream dictionaries (Table 3.4 on page 38).

           Unlike shading types 1 to 3, types 4 to 7 are represented as streams. Each stream
           contains a sequence of vertex coordinates and color data that deﬁnes the triangle
           mesh. In a type 4 shading, each vertex is speciﬁed by the following values, in the
           order shown:
              f x y c1 …cn
where
   f is the vertex’s edge ﬂag (discussed below)
   x and y are its horizontal and vertical coordinates
   c1 …cn are its color components
All vertex coordinates are expressed in the shading’s target coordinate space. If
the shading dictionary includes a Function entry, then only a single parametric
value, t, is permitted for each vertex in place of the color components c1 …cn .
The edge ﬂag associated with each vertex determines the way it connects to the
other vertices of the triangle mesh. A vertex va with an edge ﬂag value fa = 0
begins a new triangle, unconnected to any other. At least two more vertices (vb
and vc ) must be provided, but their edge ﬂags will be ignored. These three verti-
ces deﬁne a triangle (va , vb , vc ), as shown in Figure 4.16.

Subsequent triangles are deﬁned by a single new vertex combined with two verti-
ces of the preceding triangle. Given triangle (va , vb , vc ), where vertex va precedes
vertex vb in the data stream and vb precedes vc , a new vertex vd can form a new
triangle on side vbc or side vac , as shown in Figure 4.17. (Side vab is assumed to be
shared with a preceding triangle and so is not available for continuing the mesh.)
If the edge ﬂag is fd = 1 (side vbc ), the next vertex forms the triangle (vb , vc , vd ); if
the edge ﬂag is fd = 2 (side vac ), the next vertex forms the triangle (va , vc , vd ). An
edge ﬂag of fd = 0 would start a new triangle, as described above.

      FIGURE 4.17 Connecting triangles in a free-form Gouraud-shaded triangle mesh
Complex shapes can be created by using the edge ﬂags to control the edge on
which subsequent triangles are formed. Figure 4.18 shows two simple examples.
Mesh 1 begins with triangle 1 and uses the following edge ﬂags to draw each suc-
ceeding triangle:
    1 ( fa = fb = fc = 0 )                     7 ( fi = 2 )
    2 ( fd = 1 )                               8 ( fj = 2 )
    3 ( fe = 1 )                              9 ( fk = 2 )
    4 ( ff = 1 )                             10 ( f l = 1 )
    5 ( fg = 1 )                             11 ( f m = 1 )
    6 ( fh = 1 )
Mesh 2 again begins with triangle 1 and uses the edge ﬂags
   1 ( fa = fb = fc = 0 )                  4 ( ff = 2 )
   2 ( fd = 1 )                            5 ( fg = 2 )
   3 ( fe = 2 )                            6 ( fh = 2 )
The stream must provide vertex data for a whole number of triangles with appro-
priate edge ﬂags; otherwise, an error will occur.

            FIGURE 4.18 Varying the value of the edge ﬂag to create different shapes
The data for each vertex consists of the following items, reading in sequence from
higher-order to lower-order bit positions:
• An edge ﬂag, expressed in BitsPerFlag bits
• A pair of horizontal and vertical coordinates, expressed in BitsPerCoordinate
   bits each
• A set of n color components (where n is the number of components in the
   shading’s color space), expressed in BitsPerComponent bits each, in the order
   expected by the sc operator
Each set of vertex data must occupy a whole number of bytes; if the total number
of bits required is not divisible by 8, the last data byte for each vertex is padded at
the end with extra bits, which are ignored. The coordinates and color values are
decoded according to the Decode array in the same way as in an image dictionary
(see “Decode Arrays” on page 271).
If the shading dictionary contains a Function entry, the color data for each vertex
must be speciﬁed by a single parametric value t, rather than by n separate color
components. All linear interpolation within the triangle mesh is done using the t
values; after interpolation, the results are passed to the function(s) speciﬁed in
the Function entry to determine the color at each point.
         Type 5 Shadings (Lattice-Form Gouraud-Shaded Triangle Meshes)
         Type 5 shadings (lattice-form Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes) are similar to
         type 4, but instead of using free-form geometry, their vertices are arranged in a
         pseudorectangular lattice, which is topologically equivalent to a rectangular grid.
         The vertices are organized into rows, which need not be geometrically linear (see
         Figure 4.19).

         The data stream for a type 5 shading has the same format as for type 4, except
         that it does not use edge ﬂags to deﬁne the geometry of the triangle mesh. The
         data for each vertex thus consists of the following values, in the order shown:
            x y c1 …cn
         where
           x and y are the vertex’s horizontal and vertical coordinates

           All vertex coordinates are expressed in the shading’s target coordinate space. If
           the shading dictionary includes a Function entry, then only a single parametric
           value, t, is permitted for each vertex in place of the color components c1 …cn .
           The VerticesPerRow entry in the shading dictionary gives the number of vertices
           in each row of the lattice. All of the vertices in a row are speciﬁed sequentially, fol-
           lowed by those for the next row. Given m rows of k vertices each, the triangles of
the mesh are constructed using the following triplets of vertices, as shown in
Figure 4.19:
    (V i , j , V i , j +1, V i +1, j )      for 0 ≤ i ≤ m – 2, 0 ≤ j ≤ k – 2
    (V i , j +1, V i +1, j , V i +1, j +1 )
See “Type 4 Shadings (Free-Form Gouraud-Shaded Triangle Meshes)” on page
243 for further details on the format of the vertex data.
Type 6 Shadings (Coons Patch Meshes)
Type 6 shadings (Coons patch meshes) are constructed from one or more color
patches, each bounded by four cubic Bézier curves. Degenerate Bézier curves are
allowed and are useful for certain graphical effects. At least one complete patch
must be speciﬁed.
A Coons patch generally has two independent aspects:
• Colors are speciﬁed for each corner of the unit square, and bilinear interpola-
   tion is used to ﬁll in colors over the entire unit square (see the upper ﬁgure in
   Plate 15).
• Coordinates are mapped from the unit square into a four-sided patch whose
   sides are not necessarily linear (see the lower ﬁgure in Plate 15). The mapping
   is continuous: the corners of the unit square map to corners of the patch and
   the sides of the unit square map to sides of the patch, as shown in Figure 4.20.
The sides of the patch are given by four cubic Bézier curves, C1 , C2 , D1 , and D2 ,
deﬁned over a pair of parametric variables u and v that vary horizontally and ver-
tically across the unit square. The four corners of the Coons patch satisfy the
equations
    C 1 (0) = D 1 (0)
    C 1 (1) = D 2 (0)
    C 2 (0) = D 1 (1)
    C 2 (1) = D 2 (1)
                                                                   C2
                                                                                  D2
    v                                                     D1

                 u
      FIGURE 4.20 Coordinate mapping from a unit square to a four-sided Coons patch
Two surfaces can be described that are linear interpolations between the bounda-
ry curves. Along the u axis, the surface SC is deﬁned by
   S C (u, v ) = ( 1 – v ) × C 1 (u) + v × C 2 (u)
Along the v axis, the surface SD is given by
   S D (u, v ) = ( 1 – u ) × D 1 (v) + u × D 2 (v)
A third surface is the bilinear interpolation of the four corners:
   S B (u, v ) = ( 1 – v ) × [ ( 1 – u ) × C 1 (0) + u × C 1 (1) ]
                     + v × [ ( 1 – u ) × C 2 (0) + u × C 2 (1) ]
The coordinate mapping for the shading is given by the surface S, deﬁned as
   S = SC + SD – SB
This deﬁnes the geometry of each patch. A patch mesh is constructed from a
sequence of one or more such colored patches.
Patches can sometimes appear to fold over on themselves—for example, if a
boundary curve intersects itself. As the value of parameter u or v increases in
parameter space, the location of the corresponding pixels in device space may
change direction, so that new pixels are mapped onto previous pixels already
mapped. If more than one point (u, v) in parameter space is mapped to the same
point in device space, the point selected will be the one with the largest value of v;
if multiple points have the same v, the one with the largest value of u will be
selected. If one patch overlaps another, the patch that appears later in the data
stream paints over the earlier one.
Note also that the patch is a control surface, rather than a painting geometry. The
outline of a projected square (that is, the painted area) might not be the same as
the patch boundary if, for example, the patch folds over on itself, as shown in
Figure 4.21.

           The data stream provides a sequence of Bézier control points and color values
           that deﬁne the shape and colors of each patch. All of a patch’s control points are
           given ﬁrst, followed by the color values for its corners. Note that this differs from
           a triangle mesh (shading types 4 and 5), in which the coordinates and color of
           each vertex are given together. All control point coordinates are expressed in the
           shading’s target coordinate space.
As in free-form triangle meshes (type 4), each patch has an edge ﬂag that tells
which edge, if any, it shares with the previous patch. An edge ﬂag of 0 begins a
new patch, unconnected to any other. This must be followed by 12 pairs of co-
ordinates, x1 y1 x2 y2 … x12 y12 , which specify the Bézier control points that
deﬁne the four boundary curves. Figure 4.22 shows how these control points cor-
respond to the cubic Bézier curves C1 , C2 , D1 , and D2 identiﬁed in Figure 4.20 on
page 251. Color values are then given for the four corners of the patch, in the
same order as the control points corresponding to the corners. Thus, c1 is the
color at coordinates (x1 , y1 ), c2 at (x4 , y4 ), c3 at (x7 , y7 ), and c4 at (x10 , y10 ), as
shown in the ﬁgure.

Figure 4.22 also shows how nonzero values of the edge ﬂag (f = 1, 2, or 3) connect
a new patch to one of the edges of the previous patch. In this case, some of the
previous patch’s control points serve implicitly as control points for the new
patch as well (see Figure 4.23), and so are not explicitly repeated in the data
stream. Table 4.32 summarizes the required data values for various values of the
edge ﬂag.

rate color components c1 …cn . All linear interpolation within the mesh is done
using the t values; after interpolation, the results are passed to the function(s)
speciﬁed in the Function entry to determine the color at each point.

Type 7 Shadings (Tensor-Product Patch Meshes)
Type 7 shadings (tensor-product patch meshes) are identical to type 6, except
that they are based on a bicubic tensor-product patch deﬁned by 16 control
points, instead of the 12 control points that deﬁne a Coons patch. The shading
dictionaries representing the two patch types differ only in the value of the
ShadingType entry and in the number of control points speciﬁed for each patch
in the data stream. Although the Coons patch is more concise and easier to use,
the tensor-product patch affords greater control over color mapping.
Note: The data format for type 7 shadings (as for types 4 through 6) is the same in
PDF as it is in PostScript. However, the numbering and order of control points was
described incorrectly in the ﬁrst printing of the PostScript Language Reference,
Third Edition. That description has been corrected here.
Like the Coons patch mapping, the tensor-product patch mapping is controlled
by the location and shape of four cubic Bézier curves marking the boundaries of
the patch. However, the tensor-product patch has four additional, “internal”
control points to adjust the mapping. The 16 control points can be arranged in a
4-by-4 array indexed by row and column, as follows (see Figure 4.24):
   p03   p13   p23   p33
   p02   p12   p22   p32
   p01   p11   p21   p31

                 FIGURE 4.24 Control points in a tensor-product patch
As in a Coons patch mesh, the geometry of the tensor-product patch is described
by a surface deﬁned over a pair of parametric variables, u and v, which vary hori-
zontally and vertically across the unit square. The surface is deﬁned by the equa-
tion
                   3     3
   S (u, v) =     ∑ ∑ pij × Bi (u) × Bj (v)
                 i=0j=0
where pij is the control point in column i and row j of the tensor, and Bi and Bj are
the Bernstein polynomials
                       3
   B 0 (t) = ( 1 – t )
                            2
   B 1 (t) = 3t × ( 1 – t )
                  2
   B 2 (t) = 3t × ( 1 – t )
                3
   B 3 (t) = t
Since each point pij is actually a pair of coordinates (xij , yij ), the surface can also
be expressed as
                    3    3
   x ( u, v ) =    ∑ ∑ xij × Bi ( u ) × Bj ( v )
                  i=0j=0
                    3    3
   y ( u, v ) =   ∑ ∑ yij × Bi ( u ) × Bj ( v )
                  i=0j=0
The geometry of the tensor-product patch can be visualized in terms of a cubic
Bézier curve moving from the bottom boundary of the patch to the top. At the
bottom and top, the control points of this curve coincide with those of the patch’s
bottom (p00 …p30 ) and top (p03 …p33 ) boundary curves, respectively. As the
curve moves from the bottom edge of the patch to the top, each of its four control
points follows a trajectory that is in turn a cubic Bézier curve deﬁned by the four
control points in the corresponding column of the array. That is, the starting
point of the moving curve follows the trajectory deﬁned by control points
p00 …p03 , the trajectory of the ending point is deﬁned by points p30 …p33 , and
those of the two intermediate control points by p10 …p13 and p20 …p23 . Equiva-
lently, the patch can be considered to be traced by a cubic Bézier curve moving
from the left edge to the right, with its control points following the trajectories
deﬁned by the rows of the coordinate array instead of the columns.
The Coons patch (type 6) is actually a special case of the tensor-product patch
(type 7) in which the four internal control points (p11 , p12 , p21 , p22 ) are implicit-
ly deﬁned by the boundary curves. The values of the internal control points are
given by the equations
   p 11 = S ( 1 ⁄3 , 1 ⁄3 )
   p 12 = S ( 1 ⁄3 , 2 ⁄3 )
   p 21 = S ( 2 ⁄3 , 1 ⁄3 )
   p 22 = S ( 2 ⁄3 , 2 ⁄3 )
where S is the Coons surface equation
   S = SC + SD – SB
discussed above under “Type 6 Shadings (Coons Patch Meshes)” on page 250. In
the more general tensor-product patch, the values of these four points are un-
restricted.
The coordinates of the control points in a tensor-product patch are actually
speciﬁed in the shading’s data stream in the following order:
   4      5       6         7
   3     14    15           8
   2     13    16           9
   1     12    11         10
All control point coordinates are expressed in the shading’s target coordinate
space. These are followed by the color values for the four corners of the patch, in
the same order as the corners themselves. If the patch’s edge ﬂag f is 0, all 16
control points and four corner colors must be explicitly speciﬁed in the data
stream; if f is 1, 2, or 3, the control points and colors for the patch’s shared edge
are implicitly understood to be the same as those along the speciﬁed edge of the
previous patch, and are not repeated in the data stream. Table 4.33 summarizes
the data values for various values of the edge ﬂag f, expressed in terms of the row
and column indices used in Figure 4.24 above.

   4.7 External Objects
         An external object (commonly called an XObject) is a graphics object whose con-
         tents are deﬁned by a self-contained content stream, separate from the content
         stream in which it is used. There are three types of external object:
         • An image XObject (Section 4.8.4, “Image Dictionaries”) represents a sampled
            visual image such as a photograph.
         • A form XObject (Section 4.9, “Form XObjects”) is a self-contained description
            of an arbitrary sequence of graphics objects.
         • A PostScript XObject (Section 4.10, “PostScript XObjects”) contains a fragment
            of code expressed in the PostScript page description language.
         Two further categories of external objects, group XObjects and reference XObjects
         (both PDF 1.4), are actually specialized types of form XObject with additional
         properties; see Sections 4.9.2, “Group XObjects,” and 4.9.3, “Reference XObjects,”
         for additional information.
         Any XObject can be painted as part of another content stream by means of the Do
         operator (see Table 4.34). This operator applies to any type of XObject—image,
         form, or PostScript. The syntax is the same in all cases, although details of the
         operator’s behavior differ depending on the type. (See implementation note 34 in
         Appendix H.)
                                       TABLE 4.34 XObject operator
OPERANDS      OPERATOR       DESCRIPTION
name              Do         Paint the speciﬁed XObject. The operand name must appear as a key in the
                             XObject subdictionary of the current resource dictionary (see Section 3.7.2,
                             “Resource Dictionaries”); the associated value must be a stream whose Type
                             entry, if present, is XObject. The effect of Do depends on the value of the
                             XObject’s Subtype entry, which may be Image (see Section 4.8.4, “Image Dic-
                             tionaries”), Form (Section 4.9, “Form XObjects”), or PS (Section 4.10, “Post-
                             Script XObjects”).
4.8 Images
    PDF’s painting operators include general facilities for dealing with sampled im-
    ages. A sampled image (or just image for short) is a rectangular array of sample
    values, each representing a color. The image may approximate the appearance of
    some natural scene obtained through an input scanner or a video camera, or it
    may be generated synthetically.
                               FIGURE 4.25 Typical sampled image
    An image is deﬁned by a sequence of samples obtained by scanning the image
    array in row or column order. Each sample in the array consists of as many color
    components as are needed for the color space in which they are speciﬁed—for
    example, one component for DeviceGray, three for DeviceRGB, four for Device-
    CMYK, or whatever number is required by a particular DeviceN space. Each com-
    ponent is a 1-, 2-, 4-, or 8-bit integer, permitting the representation of 2, 4, 16, or
    256 distinct values for each component.
    PDF provides two means for specifying images:
    • An image XObject (described in Section 4.8.4, “Image Dictionaries”) is a
      stream object whose dictionary speciﬁes attributes of the image and whose
      data contains the image samples. Like all external objects, it is painted on the
      page by invoking the Do operator in a content stream (see Section 4.7, “Exter-
      nal Objects”). Image XObjects have other uses as well, such as for alternate
      images (see “Alternate Images” on page 273), image masks (Section 4.8.5,
        “Masked Images”), and thumbnail images (Section 8.2.3, “Thumbnail
        Images”).
      • An inline image is a small image that is completely deﬁned—both attributes
        and data—directly inline within a content stream. The kinds of image that can
        be represented in this way are limited; see Section 4.8.6, “Inline Images,” for
        details.
4.8.1 Image Parameters
      The properties of an image—resolution, orientation, scanning order, and so
      forth—are entirely independent of the characteristics of the raster output device
      on which the image is to be rendered. A PDF viewer application usually renders
      images by a sampling technique that attempts to approximate the color values of
      the source as accurately as possible. The actual accuracy achieved depends on the
      resolution and other properties of the output device.
      To paint an image, four interrelated items must be speciﬁed:
      • The format of the image: number of columns (width), number of rows
        (height), number of color components per sample, and number of bits per
        color component
      • The sample data constituting the image’s visual content
      • The correspondence between coordinates in user space and those in the image’s
        own internal coordinate space, deﬁning the region of user space that will re-
        ceive the image
      • The mapping from color component values in the image data to component
        values in the image’s color space
      All of these items are speciﬁed explicitly or implicitly by an image XObject or an
      inline image.
      Note: For convenience, the following sections refer consistently to the object deﬁning
      an image as an image dictionary. Although this term properly refers only to the
      dictionary portion of the stream object representing an image XObject, it should be
      understood to apply equally to the stream’s data portion or to the parameters and
      data of an inline image.
4.8.2 Sample Representation
      The source format for an image can be described by four parameters:
      •  The width of the image in samples
      •  The height of the image in samples
      •  The number of color components per sample
      •  The number of bits per color component
      The image dictionary speciﬁes the width, the height, and the number of bits per
      component explicitly; the number of color components can be inferred from the
      color space speciﬁed in the dictionary.
      Sample data is represented as a stream of bytes, interpreted as 8-bit unsigned
      integers in the range 0 to 255. The bytes constitute a continuous bit stream, with
      the high-order bit of each byte ﬁrst. This bit stream, in turn, is divided into units
      of n bits each, where n is the number of bits per component. Byte boundaries are
      ignored, except that each row of sample data must begin on a byte boundary. If
      the number of data bits per row is not a multiple of 8, the end of the row is pad-
      ded with extra bits to ﬁll out the last byte. A PDF viewer application ignores these
      padding bits.
      Each n-bit unit within the bit stream is interpreted as an unsigned integer in the
      range 0 to 2n − 1, with the high-order bit ﬁrst; the image dictionary’s Decode
      entry maps this to a color component value, equivalent to what could be used
      with color operators such as sc or g. Color components are interleaved sample by
      sample; for example, in a three-component RGB image, the red, green, and blue
      components for one sample are followed by the red, green, and blue components
      for the next.
      Normally, the color samples in an image are interpreted according to the color
      space speciﬁed in the image dictionary (see Section 4.5, “Color Spaces”), without
      reference to the color parameters in the graphics state. However, if the image dic-
      tionary’s ImageMask entry is true, the sample data is interpreted as a stencil mask
      for applying the graphics state’s nonstroking color parameters (see “Stencil
      Masking” on page 276).
4.8.3 Image Coordinate System
      Each image has its own internal coordinate system, or image space. The image oc-
      cupies a rectangle in image space w units wide and h units high, where w and h
      are the width and height of image in samples. Each sample occupies one square
      unit. The coordinate origin (0, 0) is at the upper-left corner of the image, with
      coordinates ranging from 0 to w horizontally and 0 to h vertically.
      The image’s sample data is ordered by row, with the horizontal coordinate vary-
      ing most rapidly. This is shown in Figure 4.26, where the numbers inside the
      squares indicate the order of the samples, counting from 0. The upper-left corner
      of the ﬁrst sample is at coordinates (0, 0), the second at (1, 0), and so on through
      the last sample of the ﬁrst row, whose upper-left corner is at (w − 1, 0) and whose
      upper-right corner is at (w, 0). The next samples after that are at coordinates
      (0, 1), (1, 1), and so on, until the ﬁnal sample of the image, whose upper-left cor-
      ner is at (w − 1, h − 1) and whose lower-right corner is at (w, h).

      Note: The image coordinate system and scanning order imposed by PDF do not pre-
      clude using different conventions in the actual image. Coordinate transformations
      can be used to map from other conventions to the PDF convention.
The correspondence between image space and user space is constant: the unit
square of user space, bounded by user coordinates (0, 0) and (1, 1), corresponds
to the boundary of the image in image space (see Figure 4.27). Following the
normal convention for user space, the coordinate (0, 0) is at the lower-left corner
of this square, corresponding to coordinates (0, h) in image space. The transfor-
mation from image space to user space could be described by the matrix
[1⁄w 0 0 −1⁄h 0 1].

                         FIGURE 4.27 Mapping the source image
An image can be placed on the output page in any desired position, orientation,
and size by using the cm operator to modify the current transformation matrix
(CTM) so as to map the unit square of user space to the rectangle or parallelo-
gram in which the image is to be painted. Typically, this is done within a pair of q
and Q operators to isolate the effect of the transformation, which can include
translation, rotation, reﬂection, and skew (see Section 4.2, “Coordinate Sys-
tems”). For example, if the XObject subdictionary of the current resource
dictionary deﬁnes the name Image1 to denote an image XObject, the code shown
in Example 4.23 paints the image in a rectangle whose lower-left corner is at
coordinates (100, 200), that is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise, and that is
150 units wide and 80 units high.

        (As discussed in Section 4.2.3, “Transformation Matrices,” these three transfor-
        mations could be combined into one.) Of course, if the aspect ratio (width to
        height) of the original image in this example is different from 150:80, the result
        will be distorted.
  4.8.4 Image Dictionaries
        Table 4.35 lists the entries in an image dictionary—that is, in the dictionary por-
        tion of a stream representing an image XObject—in addition to the usual entries
        common to all streams (see Table 3.4 on page 38). There are many relationships
        among these entries, and the current color space may limit the choices for some
        of them. Attempting to use an image dictionary whose entries are inconsistent
        with each other or with the current color space will cause an error.
        Note: The entries described here are those that are appropriate for a base image—
        one that is invoked directly with the Do operator. Some of these entries are not
        relevant for images used in other ways, such as for alternate images (see “Alternate
        Images” on page 273), image masks (Section 4.8.5, “Masked Images”), or thumbnail
        images (Section 8.2.3, “Thumbnail Images”). Except as noted, such irrelevant
        entries are simply ignored.

Decode Arrays
An image’s data stream is initially decomposed into integers in the domain 0 to
2n − 1, where n is the value of the image dictionary’s BitsPerComponent entry.
The image’s Decode array speciﬁes a linear mapping of each integer component
value to a number that would be appropriate as a component value in the image’s
color space.
Each pair of numbers in a Decode array speciﬁes the lower and upper values to
which the domain of sample values in the image is mapped. A Decode array con-
tains one pair of numbers for each component in the color space speciﬁed by the
image’s ColorSpace entry. The mapping for each color component is a linear
transformation. That is, it uses the following formula for linear interpolation:
   y = Interpolate ( x , x min , x max , y min , y max )
                                          y max – y min 
      = y min +  ( x – x min ) × --------------------------- 
                                                            -
                                          x max – x min 
Generally, this is used to convert a value x between xmin and xmax to a corre-
sponding value y between ymin and ymax , projecting along the line deﬁned by the
points (xmin , ymin ) and (xmax , ymax ). While this formula applies to values out-
side the domain xmin to xmax and does not require that xmin < xmax , note that in-
terpolation used for color conversion, such as the Decode array, does require that
xmin < xmax and “clips” x values to this domain, so that y = ymin for all x ≤ xmin ,
and y = ymax for all x ≥ xmax .
For a Decode array of the form [Dmin Dmax ], this can be written as
                                 n
   y = Interpolate ( x, 0, 2 – 1, D min , D max )
                       D max – D min 
      = D min +  x × ------------------------------ 
                                                   -
                                 n                  
                               2 –1
where
  n is the value of BitsPerComponent
  x is the input value, in the domain 0 to 2n − 1
  Dmin and Dmax are the values speciﬁed in the Decode array
  y is the output value, to be interpreted in the image’s color space
Samples with a value of 0 are mapped to Dmin , those with a value of 2n − 1 are
mapped to Dmax , and those with intermediate values are mapped linearly be-
tween Dmin and Dmax . Table 4.36 lists the default Decode arrays for use with the
various color spaces. For most color spaces, the Decode arrays listed in the table
map into the full range of allowed component values. For an Indexed color space,
the default Decode array ensures that component values that index a color table
are passed through unchanged.

                      component)
It is possible to specify a mapping that inverts sample color intensities, by specify-
ing a Dmin value greater than Dmax . For example, if the image’s color space is
DeviceGray and the Decode array is [1.0 0.0], an input value of 0 will be mapped
to 1.0 (white), while an input value of 2n − 1 will be mapped to 0.0 (black).
The Dmin and Dmax parameters for a color component are not required to fall
within the range of values allowed for that component. For instance, if an appli-
cation uses 6-bit numbers as its native image sample format, it can represent
those samples in PDF in 8-bit form, setting the two unused high-order bits of
each sample to 0. The image dictionary should then specify a Decode array of
[0.00000 4.04762], which maps input values from 0 to 63 into the range 0.0 to 1.0
(4.04762 being approximately equal to 255 ÷ 63). If an output value falls outside
the range allowed for a component, it will automatically be adjusted to the near-
est allowed value.
Image Interpolation
When the resolution of a source image is signiﬁcantly lower than that of the out-
put device, each source sample covers many device pixels. This can cause images
to appear “jaggy” or “blocky.” These visual artifacts can be reduced by applying
an image interpolation algorithm during rendering. Instead of painting all pixels
covered by a source sample with the same color, image interpolation attempts to
produce a smooth transition between adjacent sample values. Because it may in-
crease the time required to render the image, image interpolation is disabled by
default; setting the Interpolate entry in the image dictionary to true enables it.
Note: The interpolation algorithm is implementation-dependent and is not speciﬁed
by PDF. Image interpolation may not always be performed for some classes of images
or on some output devices.
Alternate Images
Alternate images (PDF 1.3) provide a straightforward and backward-compatible
way to include multiple versions of an image in a PDF ﬁle for different purposes.
These variant representations of the image may differ, for example, in resolution
or in color space. The primary goal is to reduce the need to maintain separate
versions of a PDF document for low-resolution on-screen viewing and high-
resolution printing.
In PDF 1.3, a base image (that is, the image XObject referred to in a resource
dictionary) can contain an Alternates entry. The value of this entry is an array of
alternate image dictionaries specifying variant representations of the base image.
Each alternate image dictionary contains an image XObject for one variant and
speciﬁes its properties. Table 4.37 shows the contents of an alternate image dic-
tionary.
                              TABLE 4.37 Entries in an alternate image dictionary

                                                                                                    sion to be used for printing. At most one alternate for a given base image may
                                                                                                    be so designated. If no alternate has this entry set to true, the base image itself
                                                                                                    is used for printing.
          Example 4.25 shows an image with a single alternate. The base image is a gray-
          scale image, and the alternate is a high-resolution RGB image stored on a Web
          server.

4.8.5 Masked Images
      Ordinarily, in the opaque imaging model, images mark all areas they occupy on
      the page as if with opaque paint. All portions of the image, whether black, white,
      gray, or color, completely obscure any marks that may previously have existed in
      the same place on the page. In the graphic arts industry and page layout appli-
      cations, however, it is common to crop or “mask out” the background of an
      image and then place the masked image on a different background, allowing the
      existing background to show through the masked areas. A number of PDF fea-
      tures are available for achieving such masking effects (see implementation note
      37 in Appendix H):
      • The ImageMask entry in the image dictionary, available in all versions of PDF,
        speciﬁes that the image data is to be used as a stencil mask for painting in the
        current color.
      • The Mask entry in the image dictionary (PDF 1.3) may specify a separate image
        XObject to be used as an explicit mask specifying which areas of the image to
        paint and which to mask out.
      • Alternatively, the   Mask entry (PDF 1.3) may specify a range of colors to be
        masked out wherever they occur within the image; this technique is known as
        color key masking.
Note: Although the Mask entry is a PDF 1.3 feature, its effects are commonly simu-
lated in earlier versions of PDF by deﬁning a clipping path enclosing only those of an
image’s samples that are to be painted. However, implementation limits can cause
errors if the clipping path is very complex (or if there is more than one clipping path).
An alternative way to achieve the effect of an explicit mask in PDF 1.2 is to deﬁne the
image being clipped as a pattern, make it the current color, and then paint the ex-
plicit mask as an image whose ImageMask entry is true. In any case, the PDF 1.3
features allow masked images to be placed on the page without regard to the com-
plexity of the clipping path.
In the transparent imaging model, a fourth type of masking effect, soft masking, is
available via the SMask entry in the image dictionary (PDF 1.4); see Section 7.5.4,
“Specifying Soft Masks,” for further discussion.
Stencil Masking
An image mask (an image XObject whose ImageMask entry is true) is a mono-
chrome image, in which each sample is speciﬁed by a single bit. However, instead
of being painted in opaque black and white, the image mask is treated as a stencil
mask that is partly opaque and partly transparent. Sample values in the image do
not represent black and white pixels; rather, they designate places on the page
that should either be marked with the current color or masked out (not marked
at all). Areas that are masked out retain their former contents. The effect is like
applying paint in the current color through a cut-out stencil, which allows the
paint to reach the page in some places and masks it out in others.
An image mask differs from an ordinary image in the following signiﬁcant ways:
• The image dictionary does not contain a           ColorSpace entry, because sample
   values represent masking properties (1 bit per sample) rather than colors.
• The value of the BitsPerComponent entry must be 1.
• The Decode entry determines how the source samples are to be interpreted. If
   the Decode array is [0 1] (the default for an image mask), a sample value of 0
   marks the page with the current color, while a 1 leaves the previous contents
   unchanged; if the Decode array is [1 0], these meanings are reversed.
One of the most important uses of stencil masking is for painting character
glyphs represented as bitmaps. Using such a glyph as a stencil mask transfers only
its “black” bits to the page, while leaving the “white” bits (which are really just
background) unchanged. For reasons discussed in Section 5.5.4, “Type 3 Fonts,”
an image mask, rather than an image, should almost always be used to paint
glyph bitmaps.
Note: If image interpolation (see “Image Interpolation” on page 273) is requested
during stencil masking, the effect is to smooth the edges of the mask, not to interpo-
late the painted color values. This can minimize the “jaggy” appearance of a low-
resolution stencil mask.
Explicit Masking
In PDF 1.3, the Mask entry in an image dictionary may be an image mask, as de-
scribed above under “Stencil Masking,” which serves as an explicit mask for the
primary (base) image. The base image and the image mask need not have the
same resolution (Width and Height values), but since all images are deﬁned on
the unit square in user space, their boundaries on the page will coincide; that is,
they will overlay each other. The image mask indicates which places on the page
are to be painted and which are to be masked out (left unchanged). Unmasked
areas are painted with the corresponding portions of the base image; masked
areas are not.
Color Key Masking
In PDF 1.3, the Mask entry in an image dictionary may alternatively be an array
specifying a range of colors to be masked out. Samples in the image that fall with-
in this range are not painted, allowing the existing background to show through.
The effect is similar to that of the video technique known as chroma-key.
For color key masking, the value of the Mask entry is an array of 2 × n integers,
[ min1 max1 … minn maxn ], where n is the number of color components in the
image’s color space. Each integer must be in the range 0 to 2BitsPerComponent − 1,
representing color values before decoding with the Decode array. An image sam-
ple is masked (not painted) if all of its color components before decoding,
c1 …cn , fall within the speciﬁed ranges (that is, if mini ≤ ci ≤ maxi for all
1 ≤ i ≤ n).
         Note: When color key masking is speciﬁed, the use of a DCTDecode ﬁlter for the
         stream is not recommended. DCTDecode is a lossy ﬁlter, meaning that the output is
         only an approximation of the original input data. This can lead to slight changes in
         the color values of image samples, possibly causing samples that were intended to be
         masked to be unexpectedly painted instead, in colors slightly different from the mask
         color.
  4.8.6 Inline Images
         As an alternative to the image XObjects described in Section 4.8.4, “Image Dictio-
         naries,” a sampled image may be speciﬁed in the form of an inline image. This
         type of image is deﬁned directly within the content stream in which it will be
         painted, rather than as a separate object. Because the inline format gives the
         viewer application less ﬂexibility in managing the image data, it should be used
         only for small images (4 KB or less).
         An inline image object is delimited in the content stream by the operators BI
         (begin image), ID (image data), and EI (end image); these operators are summa-
         rized in Table 4.38. BI and ID bracket a series of key-value pairs specifying the
         characteristics of the image, such as its dimensions and color space; the image
         data follows between the ID and EI operators. The format is thus analogous to
         that of a stream object such as an image XObject:
            BI
            …Key-value pairs…
            ID
            …Image data…
            EI
                                   TABLE 4.38 Inline image operators
OPERANDS    OPERATOR      DESCRIPTION
—               BI        Begin an inline image object.
—               ID        Begin the image data for an inline image object.
—               EI        End an inline image object.
Inline image objects may not be nested; that is, two BI operators may not appear
without an intervening EI to close the ﬁrst object. Similarly, an ID operator may
appear only between a BI and its balancing EI. Unless the image uses ASCIIHex-
Decode or ASCII85Decode as one of its ﬁlters, the ID operator should be followed
by a single white-space character; the next character after that is interpreted as
the ﬁrst byte of image data.
The key-value pairs appearing between the BI and ID operators are analogous to
those in the dictionary portion of an image XObject (though the syntax is differ-
ent). Table 4.39 shows the entries that are valid for an inline image, all of which
have the same meanings as in a stream dictionary (Table 3.4 on page 38) or an
image dictionary (Table 4.35 on page 267). Entries other than those listed will be
ignored; in particular, the Type, Subtype, and Length entries normally found in a
stream or image dictionary are unnecessary. For convenience, the abbreviations
shown in the table may be used in place of the fully spelled-out keys; Table 4.40
shows additional abbreviations that can be used for the names of color spaces and
ﬁlters. Note, however, that these abbreviations are valid only in inline images;
they may not be used in image XObjects. Also note that JBIG2Decode is not listed
in Table 4.40, because that ﬁlter can be applied only to image XObjects.

The color space speciﬁed by the ColorSpace (or CS) entry may be any of the stan-
dard device color spaces (DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, or DeviceCMYK). It may not be
a CIE-based color space or a special color space, with the exception of a limited
form of Indexed color space whose base color space is a device space and whose
color table is speciﬁed by a string (see “Indexed Color Spaces” on page 199).
Beginning with PDF 1.2, the value of the ColorSpace entry may also be the name
of a color space in the ColorSpace subdictionary of the current resource diction-
ary (see Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries”); in this case, the name may desig-
nate any color space that can be used with an image XObject.
Note: The names DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, and DeviceCMYK (as well as their abbre-
viations G, RGB, and CMYK) always identify the corresponding color spaces directly;
they never refer to resources in the ColorSpace subdictionary.
The image data in an inline image may be encoded using any of the standard PDF
ﬁlters. The bytes between the ID and EI operators are treated much the same as a
stream object’s data (see Section 3.2.7, “Stream Objects”), even though they do
not follow the standard stream syntax. (This is an exception to the usual rule that
    the data in a content stream is interpreted according to the standard PDF syntax
    for objects.)
    Example 4.26 shows an inline image 17 samples wide by 17 high with 8 bits per
    component in the DeviceRGB color space. The image has been encoded using
    LZW and ASCII base-85 encoding. The cm operator is used to scale it to a width
    and height of 17 units in user space and position it at coordinates (298, 388). The
    q and Q operators encapsulate the cm operation to limit its effect to resizing the
    image.

4.9 Form XObjects
    A form XObject is a self-contained description of any sequence of graphics objects
    (including path objects, text objects, and sampled images), deﬁned as a PDF
    content stream. It may be painted multiple times—either on several pages or at
    several locations on the same page—and will produce the same results each time,
    subject only to the graphics state at the time it is invoked. Not only is this shared
    deﬁnition economical to represent in the PDF ﬁle, but under suitable circum-
    stances the PDF viewer application can optimize execution by caching the results
    of rendering the form XObject for repeated reuse.
    Note: The term form also refers to a completely different kind of object, an inter-
    active form (sometimes called an AcroForm), discussed in Section 8.6, “Interactive
    Forms.” Whereas the form XObjects described in this section correspond to the notion
of forms in the PostScript language, interactive forms are the PDF equivalent of the
familiar paper instrument. Any unqualiﬁed use of the word form is understood to
refer to an interactive form; the type of form described here is always referred to ex-
plicitly as a form XObject.
Form XObjects have various uses:
• As its name suggests, a form XObject can serve as the template for an entire
   page. For example, a program that prints ﬁlled-in tax forms can ﬁrst paint the
   ﬁxed template as a form XObject and then paint the variable information on
   top of it.
• Any graphical element that is to be used repeatedly, such as a company logo or
   a standard component in the output from a computer-aided design system, can
   be deﬁned as a form XObject.
• Certain document elements that are not part of a page’s contents, such as
   annotation appearances (see Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”), are repre-
   sented as form XObjects.
• A specialized type of form XObject, called a group XObject (PDF 1.4), can be
   used to group graphical elements together as a unit for various purposes (see
   Section 4.9.2, “Group XObjects”). In particular, group XObjects are used to de-
   ﬁne transparency groups and soft masks for use in the transparent imaging
   model (see “Soft-Mask Dictionaries” on page 445 and Section 7.5.5, “Transpar-
   ency Group XObjects”).
• Another specialized type of form XObject, a reference XObject (PDF 1.4), can be
   used to import content from one PDF document into another (see Section
   4.9.3, “Reference XObjects”).
The use of form XObjects requires two steps:
1. Deﬁne the appearance of the form XObject. A form XObject is a PDF content
    stream. The dictionary portion of the stream (called the form dictionary)
    contains descriptive information about the form XObject, while the body of
    the stream describes the graphics objects that produce its appearance. The
    contents of the form dictionary are described in Section 4.9.1, “Form Diction-
    aries.”
2. Paint the form XObject. The Do operator (see Section 4.7, “External Objects”)
    paints a form XObject whose name is supplied as an operand. (The name is
    deﬁned in the XObject subdictionary of the current resource dictionary.)
         Before invoking this operator, the content stream in which it appears should
         set appropriate parameters in the graphics state; in particular, it should alter
         the current transformation matrix to control the position, size, and orienta-
         tion of the form XObject in user space.
      Each form XObject is deﬁned in its own coordinate system, called form space. The
      BBox entry in the form dictionary is expressed in form space, as are any coor-
      dinates used in the form XObject’s content stream, such as path coordinates. The
      Matrix entry in the form dictionary speciﬁes the mapping from form space to the
      current user space; each time the form XObject is painted by the Do operator, this
      matrix is concatenated with the current transformation matrix to deﬁne the
      mapping from form space to device space. (This differs from the Matrix entry in a
      pattern dictionary, which maps pattern space to the initial user space of the con-
      tent stream in which the pattern is used.)
      When the Do operator is applied to a form XObject, it does the following:
      1. Saves the current graphics state, as if by invoking the q operator (see Section
         4.3.3, “Graphics State Operators”)
      2. Concatenates the matrix from the form dictionary’s Matrix entry with the cur-
         rent transformation matrix (CTM)
      3. Clips according to the form dictionary’s BBox entry
      4. Paints the graphics objects speciﬁed in the form’s content stream
      5. Restores the saved graphics state, as if by invoking the Q operator (see Section
         4.3.3, “Graphics State Operators”)
      Except as described above, the initial graphics state for the form is inherited from
      the graphics state that is in effect at the time Do is invoked.
4.9.1 Form Dictionaries
      Every form XObject has a form type, which determines the format and meaning
      of the entries in its form dictionary. At the time of publication, only one form
      type, type 1, has been deﬁned. Table 4.41 shows the contents of the form diction-
      ary for this type of form XObject, in addition to the usual entries common to all
      streams (see Table 3.4 on page 38).

4.9.2 Group XObjects
      A group XObject (PDF 1.4) is a special type of form XObject that can be used to
      group graphical elements together as a unit for various purposes. It is distin-
      guished by the presence of the optional Group entry in the form dictionary (see
      Section 4.9.1, “Form Dictionaries”). The value of this entry is a subsidiary group
      attributes dictionary describing the properties of the group.
      As shown in Table 4.42, every group XObject has a group subtype (speciﬁed by the
      S entry in the group attributes dictionary) that determines the format and mean-
      ing of the dictionary’s remaining entries. Only one such subtype is deﬁned in
      PDF 1.4, a transparency group XObject (subtype Transparency) representing a
      transparency group for use in the transparent imaging model (see Section 7.3,
      “Transparency Groups”). The remaining contents of this type of dictionary are
      described in Section 7.5.5, “Transparency Group XObjects.”

                                                                                                    maining contents of this type of dictionary. Other group subtypes may be added

  4.9.3 Reference XObjects
        Reference XObjects (PDF 1.4) enable one PDF document to import content from
        another. The document in which the reference occurs is called the containing
        document; the one whose content is being imported is the target document. The
        target document may reside in a ﬁle external to the containing document or may
        be included within it as an embedded ﬁle stream (see Section 3.10.3, “Embedded
        File Streams”).
        The reference XObject in the containing document is a form XObject containing
        the optional Ref entry in its form dictionary, as described below. This object
        serves as a proxy that can be displayed or printed in place of the imported con-
        tent. The proxy might consist of a low-resolution image of the imported content,
        a piece of descriptive text referring to it, a gray box to be displayed in its place, or
        any other similar placeholder. Viewer applications that do not recognize the Ref
        entry will simply display or print the proxy as an ordinary form XObject; those
        that do implement reference XObjects can use the proxy in place of the imported
        content if the latter is unavailable. A viewer application may also provide a user
        interface to allow editing and updating of imported content links.
        The imported content consists of a single, complete PDF page in the target docu-
        ment. It is designated by a reference dictionary, which in turn is the value of the
        Ref entry in the reference XObject’s form dictionary (see Section 4.9.1, “Form
        Dictionaries”). It is the presence of the Ref entry that distinguishes reference
        XObjects from other types of form XObject. Table 4.43 shows the contents of the
        reference dictionary.

                                                                                                    validated if the referenced page is changed or replaced in the target document
                                                                                                    after the reference is created.

                                                                                                    entry improves a viewer application’s chances of ﬁnding the intended ﬁle and
                                                                                                    allows it to warn the user if the ﬁle has changed since the reference was created.
     When the imported content replaces the proxy, it is transformed according to the
     proxy object’s transformation matrix and clipped to the boundaries of its bound-
     ing box, as speciﬁed by the Matrix and BBox entries in the proxy’s form dictionary
     (see Section 4.9.1, “Form Dictionaries”). The combination of the proxy object’s
     matrix and bounding box thus implicitly deﬁnes the bounding box of the im-
     ported page. This bounding box will typically coincide with the imported page’s
     crop box or art box (see Section 9.10.1, “Page Boundaries”), but it is not required
     to correspond to any of the deﬁned page boundaries. If the proxy object’s form
     dictionary contains a Group entry, the speciﬁed group attributes apply to the im-
     ported page as well; this allows the imported page to be treated as a group with-
     out further modiﬁcation.
     Printing Reference XObjects
     When printing a page containing reference XObjects, a viewer application may
     emit any of the following, depending on the capabilities of the viewer application,
     the user’s preferences, and the nature of the print job:
     • The imported content designated by the reference XObject
     • The reference XObject itself, as a proxy for the imported content
     • An OPI proxy or substitute image taken from the reference XObject’s OPI dic-
        tionary, if any (see Section 9.10.6, “Open Prepress Interface (OPI)”)
     The imported content or the reference XObject itself may also be emitted in place
     of an OPI proxy when generating OPI comments in a PostScript output stream.
     Special Considerations
     Certain special considerations arise when reference XObjects interact with other
     PDF features:
     • When the page imported by a reference XObject contains annotations (see Sec-
        tion 8.4, “Annotations”), all annotations that contain a printable, unhidden,
        visible appearance stream (Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”) must be in-
        cluded in the rendering of the imported page. If the proxy is a snapshot image
        of the imported page, it must also include the annotation appearances. These
        appearances must therefore be converted into part of the proxy’s content
        stream, either as subsidiary form XObjects or by “ﬂattening” them directly into
        the content stream.
     • Logical structure information associated with a page (see Section 9.6, “Logical
        Structure”) should normally be ignored when importing the page into another
        document with a reference XObject. In a target document with multiple pages,
        structure elements occurring on the imported page will typically be part of a
        larger structure pertaining to the document as a whole; such elements cannot
        meaningfully be incorporated into the structure of the containing document.
        In a one-page target document or one made up of independent, structurally
        unrelated pages, the logical structure for the imported page may be wholly self-
        contained; in this case, it may be possible to incorporate this structure infor-
        mation into that of the containing document. However, PDF provides no
        mechanism for the logical structure hierarchy of one document to refer indi-
        rectly to that of another.
4.10 PostScript XObjects
     In PDF 1.1, a content stream can include PostScript language fragments. These
     fragments are used only when printing to a PostScript output device; they have
     no effect either when viewing the document on-screen or when printing to a
     non-PostScript device. In addition, applications that understand PDF are unlike-
     ly to be able to interpret the PostScript fragments. Hence, this capability should
     be used with extreme caution and only if there is no other way to achieve the
     same result. Inappropriate use of PostScript XObjects can cause PDF ﬁles to print
     incorrectly.
        Note: Since PDF 1.4 encompasses all of the Adobe imaging model features of the
        PostScript language, there is no longer any reason to use PostScript XObjects. This
        feature is likely to be removed from PDF in a future version.
        A PostScript XObject is an XObject stream whose Subtype entry has the value PS.
        Table 4.44 shows the contents of a PostScript XObject dictionary, in addition to
        the usual entries common to all streams (see Table 3.4 on page 38).

        When a PDF content stream is translated into the PostScript language, any Do
        operation that references a PostScript XObject is replaced by the contents of the
        XObject stream itself. The stream is copied without interpretation. The Post-
        Script fragment may use Type 1 and TrueType fonts listed in the Font subdic-
        tionary of the current resource dictionary (see Section 3.7.2, “Resource
        Dictionaries”), accessing them by their BaseFont names using the PostScript
        ﬁndfont operator. The fragment may not use other types of font listed in the Font
        subdictionary. It should not reference the PostScript deﬁnitions corresponding to
        PDF procedure sets (see Section 9.1, “Procedure Sets”), which are subject to
        change.

                                     5Text
THIS CHAPTER DESCRIBES the special facilities in PDF for dealing with text—
speciﬁcally, for representing characters with glyphs from fonts. A glyph is a graph-
ical shape and is subject to all graphical manipulations, such as coordinate trans-
formation. Because of the importance of text in most page descriptions, PDF
provides higher-level facilities that permit an application to describe, select, and
render glyphs conveniently and efﬁciently.
The ﬁrst section is a general description of how glyphs from fonts are painted on
the page. Subsequent sections cover the following topics in detail:
• Text state. A subset of the graphics state parameters pertain to text, including
  parameters that select the font, scale the glyphs to an appropriate size, and
  accomplish other graphical effects.
• Text objects and operators. The text operators specify the glyphs to be painted,
  represented by string objects whose values are interpreted as sequences of char-
  acter codes. A text object encloses a sequence of text operators and associated
  parameters.
• Font data structures. Font dictionaries and associated data structures provide
  information that a viewer application needs to interpret the text and position
  the glyphs properly. The deﬁnitions of the glyphs themselves are contained in
  font programs, which may be embedded in the PDF ﬁle, built into the viewer
  application, or obtained from an external font ﬁle.

5.1 Organization and Use of Fonts
    A character is an abstract symbol, whereas a glyph is a speciﬁc graphical rendering
    of a character. For example, the glyphs A, A, and A are renderings of the abstract
    “A” character. Historically these two terms have often been used interchangeably
    in computer typography (as evidenced by the names chosen for some PDF dic-
    tionary keys and PostScript operators), but advances in this area have made the
    distinction more meaningful in recent times. Consequently, this book distin-
    guishes between characters and glyphs, though with some residual names that are
    inconsistent.
    Glyphs are organized into fonts. A font deﬁnes glyphs for a particular character
    set; for example, the Helvetica and Times fonts deﬁne glyphs for a set of standard
    Latin characters. A font for use with a PDF viewer application is prepared in the
    form of a program. Such a font program is written in a special-purpose language,
    such as the Type 1 or TrueType font format, that is understood by a specialized
    font interpreter.
    In PDF, the term font refers to a font dictionary, a PDF object that identiﬁes the
    font program and contains additional information about it. There are several dif-
    ferent font types, identiﬁed by the Subtype entry of the font dictionary.
    For most font types, the font program itself is deﬁned in a separate font ﬁle,
    which may be either embedded in a PDF stream object or obtained from an
    external source. The font program contains glyph descriptions that generate
    glyphs.
    A content stream paints glyphs on the page by specifying a font dictionary and a
    string object that is interpreted as a sequence of one or more character codes
    identifying glyphs in the font. This operation is called showing the text string.
    The glyph description consists of a sequence of graphics operators that produce
    the speciﬁc shape for that character in this font. To render a glyph, the viewer
    application executes the glyph description.
    Programmers who have experience with scan conversion of general shapes may
    be concerned about the amount of computation that this description seems to
    imply. However, this is only the abstract behavior of glyph descriptions and font
    programs, not how they are implemented. In fact, an efﬁcient implementation
    can be achieved through careful caching and reuse of previously rendered glyphs.
5.1.1 Basics of Showing Text
      Example 5.1 illustrates the most straightforward use of a font. It places the text
      ABC 10 inches from the bottom of the page and 4 inches from the left edge, using
      12-point Helvetica.

      The ﬁve lines of this example perform the following steps:
      1. Begin a text object.
      2. Set the font and font size to use, installing them as parameters in the text state.
         (The font resource identiﬁed by the name F13 speciﬁes the font externally
         known as Helvetica.)
      3. Specify a starting position on the page, setting parameters in the text object.
      4. Paint the glyphs for a string of characters there.
      5. End the text object.
      The following paragraphs explain these operations in more detail.
      To paint glyphs, a content stream must ﬁrst identify the font to be used. The Tf
      operator speciﬁes the name of a font resource—that is, an entry in the Font
      subdictionary of the current resource dictionary. The value of that entry is a font
      dictionary. The font dictionary in turn identiﬁes the font’s externally known
      name, such as Helvetica, and supplies some additional information that the view-
      er application needs to paint glyphs from that font; it optionally provides the def-
      inition of the font program itself.
      Note: The font resource name presented to the Tf operator is arbitrary, as are the
      names for all kinds of resources. It bears no relationship to an actual font name, such
      as Helvetica.
      Example 5.2 illustrates an excerpt from the current page’s resource dictionary,
      deﬁning the font dictionary that is referenced as F13 in Example 5.1.
Example 5.2
   /Resources
       << /Font << /F13 23 0 R >>
       >>
   23 0 obj
       << /Type /Font
           /Subtype /Type1
           /BaseFont /Helvetica
       >>
   endobj
A font deﬁnes the glyphs for one standard size. This standard is so arranged that
the nominal height of tightly spaced lines of text is 1 unit. In the default user
coordinate system, this means the standard glyph size is 1 unit in user space, or
1⁄72 inch. The standard-size font must then be scaled to be usable. The scale fac-
tor is speciﬁed as the second operand of the Tf operator, thereby setting the text
font size parameter in the graphics state. Example 5.1 establishes the Helvetica
font with a 12-unit size in the graphics state.
Once the font has been selected and scaled, it can be used to paint glyphs. The Td
operator adjusts the current text position (actually, the translation components
of the text matrix, as described in Section 5.3.1, “Text-Positioning Operators”).
When executed for the ﬁrst time after BT, it establishes the text position in the
current user coordinate system. This determines the position on the page at
which to begin painting glyphs.
The Tj operator takes a string operand and paints the corresponding glyphs using
the current font and other text-related parameters in the graphics state. In Exam-
ple 5.1, the Tj operator treats each element of the string (an integer in the range 0
to 255) as a character code. Each code selects a glyph description in the font, and
the glyph description is executed to paint that glyph on the page. This is the be-
havior of Tj for simple fonts, such as ordinary Latin text fonts; interpretation of
the string as a sequence of character codes is more complex for composite fonts,
described in Section 5.6, “Composite Fonts.”
Note: What these steps produce on the page is not a 12-point glyph, but rather a
12-unit glyph, where the unit size is that of the text space at the time the glyphs are
rendered on the page. The actual size of the glyph is determined by the text matrix
(Tm ) in the text object, several text state parameters, and the current transformation
      matrix (CTM) in the graphics state; see Section 5.3.3, “Text Space Details.” If the
      text space is later scaled to make the unit size 1 centimeter, painting glyphs from the
      same 12-unit font will generate results that are 12 centimeters high.
5.1.2 Achieving Special Graphical Effects
      Normal uses of Tj and other glyph-painting operators cause black-ﬁlled glyphs to
      be painted. Other effects can be obtained by combining font operators with gen-
      eral graphics operators.
      The color used for painting glyphs is the current color in the graphics state: either
      the nonstroking or the stroking color (or both), depending on the text rendering
      mode (see Section 5.2.5, “Text Rendering Mode”). The default color is black, but
      other colors can be obtained by executing an appropriate color-setting operator
      or operators (see Section 4.5.7, “Color Operators”) before painting the glyphs.
      Example 5.3 uses text rendering mode 0 and the g operator to ﬁll glyphs in 50
      percent gray, as shown in Figure 5.1.
      Example 5.3
         BT

Other graphical effects can be achieved by treating the glyph outline as a path in-
stead of ﬁlling it. The text rendering mode parameter in the graphics state speciﬁes
whether glyph outlines are to be ﬁlled, stroked, used as a clipping boundary, or
some combination of these effects. (This parameter does not apply to Type 3
fonts.)
Example 5.4 treats glyph outlines as a path to be stroked. The Tr operator sets the
text rendering mode to 1 (stroke). The w operator sets the line width to 2 units in
user space. Given those graphics state parameters, the Tj operator strokes the
glyph outlines with a line 2 points thick (see Figure 5.2).

Example 5.5 treats the glyphs’ outlines as a clipping boundary. The Tr operator
sets the text rendering mode to 7 (clip), causing the subsequent Tj operator to
impose the glyph outlines as the current clipping path. All subsequent painting
operations will mark the page only within this path, as illustrated in Figure 5.3.
This state persists until some earlier clipping path is reinstated by the Q operator.

5.1.3 Glyph Positioning and Metrics
      A glyph’s width—formally, its horizontal displacement—is the amount of space it
      occupies along the baseline of a line of text that is written horizontally. In other
      words, it is the distance the current text position moves (by translating text space)
      when the glyph is painted. Note that the width is distinct from the dimensions of
      the glyph outline.
      In some fonts, the width is constant; it does not vary from glyph to glyph. Such
      fonts are called ﬁxed-pitch or monospaced. They are used mainly for typewriter-
      style printing. However, most fonts used for high-quality typography associate a
      different width with each glyph. Such fonts are called proportional or variable-
      pitch fonts. In either case, the Tj operator positions the glyphs for consecutive
      characters of a string according to their widths.
      The width information for each glyph is stored both in the font dictionary and in
      the font program itself. (The two sets of widths must be identical; storing this in-
      formation in the font dictionary, although redundant, enables a viewer applica-
tion to determine glyph positioning without having to look inside the font
program.) The operators for showing text are designed on the assumption that
glyphs are ordinarily positioned according to their standard widths. However,
means are provided to vary the positioning in certain limited ways. For example,
the TJ operator enables the text position to be adjusted between any consecutive
pair of glyphs corresponding to characters in a text string. There are graphics
state parameters to adjust character and word spacing systematically.
In addition to width, a glyph has several other metrics that inﬂuence glyph posi-
tioning and painting. For most font types, this information is largely internal to
the font program and is not speciﬁed explicitly in the PDF font dictionary; how-
ever, in a Type 3 font, all metrics are speciﬁed explicitly (see Section 5.5.4, “Type 3
Fonts”).
The glyph coordinate system is the space in which an individual character’s glyph
is deﬁned. All path coordinates and metrics are interpreted in glyph space. For all
font types except Type 3, the units of glyph space are one-thousandth of a unit of
text space; for a Type 3 font, the transformation from glyph space to text space is
deﬁned by a font matrix speciﬁed in an explicit FontMatrix entry in the font.
Figure 5.4 shows a typical glyph outline and its metrics.

                                FIGURE 5.4 Glyph metrics
The glyph origin is the point (0, 0) in the glyph coordinate system. Tj and other
text-showing operators position the origin of the ﬁrst glyph to be painted at the
origin of text space. For example, the following code adjusts the origin of text
space to (40, 50) in the user coordinate system, and then places the origin of the A
glyph at that point:
    BT
       40 50 Td
       (ABC) Tj
    ET
The glyph displacement is the distance from the glyph’s origin to the point at
which the origin of the next glyph should normally be placed when painting the
consecutive glyphs of a line of text. This distance is a vector (called the displace-
ment vector) in the glyph coordinate system; it has horizontal and vertical com-
ponents. (A displacement that is horizontal is usually called a width.) Most
Western writing systems, including those based on the Latin alphabet, have a pos-
itive horizontal displacement and a zero vertical displacement; some Asian writ-
ing systems have a nonzero vertical displacement. In all cases, the text-showing
operators transform the displacement vector into text space and then translate
text space by that amount.
The glyph bounding box is the smallest rectangle (oriented with the axes of the
glyph coordinate system) that will just enclose the entire glyph shape. The
bounding box is expressed in terms of its left, bottom, right, and top coordinates
relative to the glyph origin in the glyph coordinate system.
In some writing systems, text is frequently aligned in two different directions. For
example, it is common to write Japanese and Chinese glyphs either horizontally
or vertically. To handle this, a font can optionally contain a second set of metrics
for each glyph. Which set of metrics to use is selected according to a writing
mode, where 0 speciﬁes horizontal writing and 1 speciﬁes vertical writing. This
feature is available only for composite fonts, discussed in Section 5.6, “Composite
Fonts.”
When a glyph has two sets of metrics, each set speciﬁes a glyph origin and a dis-
placement vector for that writing mode. In vertical writing, the glyph position is
described by a position vector from the origin used for horizontal writing
(origin 0) to the origin used for vertical writing (origin 1). Figure 5.5 illustrates
the metrics for the two writing modes, as follows:
• The left diagram illustrates the glyph metrics associated with writing mode 0,
   horizontal writing. The coordinates ll and ur specify the bounding box of the
   glyph relative to origin 0. w0 is the displacement vector that speciﬁes how the
         text position is changed after the glyph is painted in writing mode 0; its vertical
         component is always 0.
      • The center diagram illustrates writing mode 1, vertical writing. w1 is the dis-
         placement vector for writing mode 1; its horizontal component is always 0.
      • In the right diagram, v is a position vector deﬁning the position of origin 1 rel-
         ative to origin 0.

      Glyph metric information is also available separately in the form of Adobe font
      metrics (AFM) and Adobe composite font metrics (ACFM) ﬁles. These ﬁles are
      for use by application programs that generate PDF page descriptions and must
      make formatting decisions based on the widths and other metrics of glyphs. Also
      available in the AFM and ACFM ﬁles is kerning information, which allows an
      application generating a PDF ﬁle to determine spacing adjustments between
      characters depending on context. Speciﬁcations for the AFM and ACFM ﬁle for-
      mats are available in Adobe Technical Note #5004, Adobe Font Metrics File Format
      Speciﬁcation; the ﬁles themselves can be obtained from the ASN Developer Pro-
      gram Web site (see the Bibliography).
5.2 Text State Parameters and Operators
      The text state comprises those graphics state parameters that only affect text.
      There are nine parameters in the text state (see Table 5.1).
                            TABLE 5.1 Text state parameters
PARAMETER             DESCRIPTION
   Tc                 Character spacing
   Tw                 Word spacing
   Th                 Horizontal scaling
   Tl                 Leading
   Tf                 Text font
   Tfs                Text font size
   Tmode              Text rendering mode
   Trise              Text rise
   Tk                 Text knockout
Except for the self-explanatory Tf and Tfs , these parameters are discussed further
in the following sections. (As described in Section 5.3, “Text Objects,” three addi-
tional text-related parameters are deﬁned only within a text object: Tm , the text
matrix; Tlm , the text line matrix; and Trm , the text rendering matrix.) The values
of the text state parameters are consulted when text is positioned and shown
(using the operators described in Sections 5.3.1, “Text-Positioning Operators,”
and 5.3.2, “Text-Showing Operators”). In particular, the spacing and scaling
parameters participate in a computation described in Section 5.3.3, “Text Space
Details.” The text state parameters can be set using the operators listed in Table
5.2.
Note: The text knockout parameter, Tk , is set via the TK entry in a graphics state pa-
rameter dictionary, using the gs operator (see Section 4.3.4, “Graphics State Param-
eter Dictionaries”). There is no speciﬁc operator for setting this parameter.
The text state operators can appear outside text objects, and the values they set
are retained across text objects in a single content stream. Like other graphics
state parameters, these parameters are initialized to their default values at the
beginning of each page.

OPERANDS       OPERATOR       DESCRIPTION
charSpace         Tc          Set the character spacing, Tc , to charSpace, which is a number expressed in un-
                              scaled text space units. Character spacing is used by the Tj, TJ, and ' operators.
                              Initial value: 0.
wordSpace         Tw          Set the word spacing, Tw , to wordSpace, which is a number expressed in unscaled
                              text space units. Word spacing is used by the Tj, TJ, and ' operators. Initial
                              value: 0.
scale             Tz          Set the horizontal scaling, Th , to (scale ÷ 100). scale is a number specifying the
                              percentage of the normal width. Initial value: 100 (normal width).
leading           TL          Set the text leading, Tl , to leading, which is a number expressed in unscaled text
                              space units. Text leading is used only by the T*, ', and " operators. Initial value: 0.
font size         Tf          Set the text font, Tf , to font and the text font size, Tfs , to size. font is the name of a
                              font resource in the Font subdictionary of the current resource dictionary; size is
                              a number representing a scale factor. There is no initial value for either font or
                              size; they must be speciﬁed explicitly using Tf before any text is shown.
render            Tr          Set the text rendering mode, Tmode , to render, which is an integer. Initial value: 0.
rise              Ts          Set the text rise, Trise , to rise, which is a number expressed in unscaled text space
                              units. Initial value: 0.
          Note that some of these parameters are expressed in unscaled text space units.
          This means that they are speciﬁed in a coordinate system that is deﬁned by the
          text matrix, Tm , but is not scaled by the font size parameter, Tfs .
   5.2.1 Character Spacing
          The character spacing parameter, Tc , is a number speciﬁed in unscaled text space
          units (although it is subject to scaling by the Th parameter if the writing mode is
          horizontal). When the glyph for each character in the string is rendered, Tc is
          added to the horizontal or vertical component of the glyph’s displacement,
          depending on the writing mode. (See Section 5.1.3, “Glyph Positioning and
          Metrics,” for a discussion of glyph displacements.) In the default coordinate sys-
          tem, horizontal coordinates increase from left to right and vertical coordinates
          from bottom to top. So for horizontal writing, a positive value of Tc has the effect
      of expanding the distance between glyphs (see Figure 5.6), whereas for vertical
      writing, a negative value of Tc has this effect.
           Tc = 0 (default)

5.2.2 Word Spacing
      Word spacing works the same way as character spacing, but applies only to the
      space character, code 32. The word spacing parameter, Tw , is added to the glyph’s
      horizontal or vertical displacement (depending on the writing mode). For hori-
      zontal writing, a positive value for Tw has the effect of increasing the spacing be-
      tween words. For vertical writing, a positive value for Tw decreases the spacing
      between words (and a negative value increases it), since vertical coordinates in-
      crease from bottom to top. Figure 5.7 illustrates the effect of word spacing in
      horizontal writing.

      Note: Word spacing is applied to every occurrence of the single-byte character code
      32 in a string. This can occur when using a simple font or a composite font that de-
      ﬁnes code 32 as a single-byte code. It does not apply to occurrences of the byte value
      32 in multiple-byte codes.
5.2.3 Horizontal Scaling
      The horizontal scaling parameter, Th , adjusts the width of glyphs by stretching or
      compressing them in the horizontal direction. Its value is speciﬁed as a percent-
      age of the normal width of the glyphs, with 100 being the normal width. The
      scaling always applies to the horizontal coordinate in text space, independently of
      the writing mode. It affects both the glyph’s shape and its horizontal displace-
      ment (that is, its displacement vector). If the writing mode is horizontal, it also
      affects the spacing parameters Tc and Tw , as well as any positioning adjustments
      performed by the TJ operator. Figure 5.8 shows the effect of horizontal scaling.
               Th = 100 (default)

5.2.4 Leading
      The leading parameter, Tl , is measured in unscaled text space units. It speciﬁes
      the vertical distance between the baselines of adjacent lines of text, as shown in
      Figure 5.9.
                                        This is 12-point text with

                                          FIGURE 5.9 Leading
      The leading parameter is used by the TD, T*, ', and " operators; see Table 5.5 on
      page 310 for a precise description of its effects. This parameter always applies to
      the vertical coordinate in text space, independently of the writing mode.
5.2.5 Text Rendering Mode
      The text rendering mode, Tmode , determines whether showing text causes glyph
      outlines to be stroked, ﬁlled, used as a clipping boundary, or some combination
      of the three. Stroking, ﬁlling, and clipping have the same effects for a text object
      as they do for a path object (see Sections 4.4.2, “Path-Painting Operators,” and
      4.4.3, “Clipping Path Operators”), although they are speciﬁed in an entirely dif-
      ferent way. The graphics state parameters affecting those operations, such as line
      width, are interpreted in user space rather than in text space.
      Note: The text rendering mode has no effect on text displayed in a Type 3 font (see
      Section 5.5.4, “Type 3 Fonts”).
      The text rendering modes are shown in Table 5.3. In the examples, a stroke color
      of black and a ﬁll color of light gray are used. For the clipping modes (4 to 7), a
      series of lines has been drawn through the glyphs to show where the clipping
      occurs.
      If the text rendering mode calls for ﬁlling, the current nonstroking color in the
      graphics state is used; if it calls for stroking, the current stroking color is used. In
      modes that perform both ﬁlling and stroking, the effect is as if each glyph outline
      were ﬁlled and then stroked in separate operations. If any of the glyphs overlap,
      the result is equivalent to ﬁlling and stroking them one at a time, producing the
      appearance of stacked opaque glyphs, rather than ﬁrst ﬁlling and then stroking
      them all at once (see implementation note 39 in Appendix H). In the transparent
      imaging model, these combined ﬁlling and stroking modes are subject to further
      considerations; see “Special Path-Painting Considerations” on page 462.
      The behavior of the clipping modes requires further explanation. Glyph outlines
      begin accumulating if a BT operator is executed while the text rendering mode is
      set to a clipping mode or if it is set to a clipping mode within a text object. Glyphs
      accumulate until the text object is ended by an ET operator; the text rendering
      mode must not be changed back to a nonclipping mode before that point.

  7                                 Add text to path for clipping.
At the end of the text object, the accumulated glyph outlines, if any, are combined
into a single path, treating the individual outlines as subpaths of that path and
applying the nonzero winding number rule (see “Nonzero Winding Number
Rule” on page 169). The current clipping path in the graphics state is set to the
intersection of this path with the previous clipping path. As is the case for path
objects, this clipping occurs after all ﬁlling and stroking operations for the text
object have occurred. It remains in effect until some previous clipping path is re-
stored by an invocation of the Q operator.
Note: If no glyphs are shown, or if the only glyphs shown have no outlines (that is, if
they are space characters), no clipping occurs.
5.2.6 Text Rise
      Text rise, Trise , speciﬁes the distance, in unscaled text space units, to move the
      baseline up or down from its default location. Positive values of text rise move the
      baseline up. Adjustments to the baseline are useful for drawing superscripts or
      subscripts. The default location of the baseline can be restored by setting the text
      rise to 0. Figure 5.10 illustrates the effect of the text rise. Text rise always applies
      to the vertical coordinate in text space, regardless of the writing mode.

5.2.7 Text Knockout
      The text knockout parameter, Tk (PDF 1.4), is a boolean ﬂag that determines
      what text elements are considered elementary objects for purposes of color com-
      positing in the transparent imaging model. Unlike other text state parameters,
      there is no speciﬁc operator for setting this parameter; it can be set only via the
      TK entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary, using the gs operator (see Sec-
      tion 4.3.4, “Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries”).
         The text knockout parameter applies only to entire text objects; it may not be set
         between the BT and ET operators delimiting a text object. If the text knockout ﬂag
         is false, each glyph in a text object is treated as a separate elementary object;
         when glyphs overlap, they will composite with one another. If the ﬂag is true, all
         glyphs in the text object are treated together as a single elementary object; when
         glyphs overlap, later glyphs will overwrite (“knock out”) earlier ones in the area
         of overlap. (The latter behavior is equivalent to treating the entire text object as if
         it were a knockout transparency group; see Section 7.3.5, “Knockout Groups.”)
         The initial value is true.
   5.3 Text Objects
         A PDF text object consists of operators that can show text strings, move the text
         position, and set text state and certain other parameters. In addition, there are
         three parameters that are deﬁned only within a text object and do not persist
         from one text object to the next:
         • Tm , the text matrix
         • Tlm , the text line matrix
         • Trm , the text rendering matrix, actually just an intermediate result that com-
            bines the effects of text state parameters, the text matrix (Tm ), and the current
            transformation matrix
         A text object begins with the BT operator and ends with the ET operator, as shown
         below and described in Table 5.4.

OPERANDS     OPERATOR      DESCRIPTION
—               BT         Begin a text object, initializing the text matrix, Tm , and the text line matrix, Tlm , to
                           the identity matrix. Text objects cannot be nested; a second BT cannot appear before
                           an ET.
—               ET         End a text object, discarding the text matrix.
      The speciﬁc categories of text-related operators that can appear in a text object
      are:
      • Text state operators, described in Section 5.2, “Text State Parameters and Oper-
         ators.”
      • Text-positioning operators, described in Section 5.3.1, “Text-Positioning Opera-
         tors.”
      • Text-showing operators, described in Section 5.3.2, “Text-Showing Operators.”
      The latter two sections also provide further details about the text object parame-
      ters described above. The other operators that can appear in a text object are
      those related to the general graphics state, color, and marked content, as shown in
      Figure 4.1 on page 135.
      Note: If a content stream does not contain any text, the Text procedure set may be
      omitted (see Section 9.1, “Procedure Sets”). In those circumstances, no text operators
      (including operators that merely set the text state) may be present in the content
      stream, since those operators are deﬁned in the same procedure set.
      Note: Although text objects cannot be statically nested, text might be shown using a
      Type 3 font whose glyph descriptions include any graphics objects, including another
      text object. Likewise, the current color might be a tiling pattern whose pattern cell in-
      cludes a text object.
5.3.1 Text-Positioning Operators
      Text space is the coordinate system in which text is shown. It is deﬁned by the
      text matrix, Tm , and the text state parameters Tfs , Th , and Trise , which together
      determine the transformation from text space to user space. Speciﬁcally, the ori-
      gin of the ﬁrst glyph shown by a text-showing operator will be placed at the ori-
      gin of text space. If text space has been translated, scaled, or rotated, then the
      position, size, or orientation of the glyph in user space will be correspondingly
      altered.
      At the beginning of a text object, Tm is the identity matrix, so the origin of text
      space is initially the same as that of user space. The text-positioning operators, de-
      scribed in Table 5.5, alter Tm and thereby control the placement of glyphs that are
      subsequently painted. Also, the text-showing operators, described in Table 5.6 in
          the next section, update Tm (by altering its e and f translation components) to
          take into account the horizontal or vertical displacement of each glyph painted as
          well as any character or word spacing parameters in the text state.

                             (tx , ty ). tx and ty are numbers expressed in unscaled text space units. More pre-
                             cisely, this operator performs the following assignments:
                                                       1  0 0

tx t y            TD         Move to the start of the next line, offset from the start of the current line by
                             (tx , ty ). As a side effect, this operator sets the leading parameter in the text state.
                             This operator has the same effect as the code
                                  −ty TL
                                  tx ty Td
a b c d e f       Tm         Set the text matrix, Tm , and the text line matrix, Tlm , as follows:
                                                       a b 0
                                  T m = T lm =         c d0
                                                       e f 1
                             The operands are all numbers, and the initial value for Tm and Tlm is the identity
                             matrix, [1 0 0 1 0 0]. Although the operands specify a matrix, they are passed
                             to Tm as six separate numbers, not as an array.
                             The matrix speciﬁed by the operands is not concatenated onto the current text
                             matrix, but replaces it.
—                 T*         Move to the start of the next line. This operator has the same effect as the code
                                  0 Tl Td
                             where Tl is the current leading parameter in the text state.
          Additionally, a text object keeps track of a text line matrix, Tlm , which captures
          the value of Tm at the beginning of a line of text. This is convenient for aligning
           evenly spaced lines of text. The text-positioning and text-showing operators read
           and set Tlm on speciﬁc occasions mentioned in Tables 5.5 and 5.6.
           Note: The text-positioning operators can appear only within text objects.
   5.3.2 Text-Showing Operators
           The text-showing operators (Table 5.6) show text on the page, repositioning text
           space as they do so. All of the operators interpret the text string and apply the text
           state parameters as described below.

                              mentation note 40 in Appendix H). Each element of array can be a string or a
                              number. If the element is a string, this operator shows the string. If it is a num-
                              ber, the operator adjusts the text position by that amount; that is, it translates
                              the text matrix, Tm . The number is expressed in thousandths of a unit of text
                              space (see Section 5.3.3, “Text Space Details,” and implementation note 41 in
                              Appendix H). This amount is subtracted from the current horizontal or vertical
                              coordinate, depending on the writing mode. In the default coordinate system, a
                              positive adjustment has the effect of moving the next glyph painted either to the
                              left or down by the given amount. Figure 5.11 shows an example of the effect of
                              passing offsets to TJ.

        Note: The text-showing operators can appear only within text objects.
        A string operand of a text-showing operator is interpreted as a sequence of char-
        acter codes identifying the glyphs to be painted. With most font types, each byte
        of the string is treated as a separate character code. The character code is then
        looked up in the font’s encoding to select the glyph, as described in Section 5.5.5,
        “Character Encoding.”
        Beginning with PDF 1.2, a string may be shown in a composite font that uses
        multiple-byte codes to select some of its glyphs. In that case, one or more consec-
        utive bytes of the string are treated as a single character code. The code lengths
        and the mappings from codes to glyphs are deﬁned in a data structure called a
        CMap, described in Section 5.6, “Composite Fonts.”
        The strings must conform to the syntax for string objects. When a string is writ-
        ten by enclosing the data in parentheses, bytes whose values are the same as those
        of the ASCII characters left parenthesis (40), right parenthesis (41), and back-
        slash (92) must be preceded by a backslash character. All other byte values be-
        tween 0 and 255 may be used in a string object. These rules apply to each
        individual byte in a string object, whether the string is interpreted by the text-
        showing operators as single-byte or multiple-byte character codes.
        Strings presented to the text-showing operators may be of any length—even a
        single character per string—and may be placed on the page in any order. The
        grouping of glyphs into strings has no signiﬁcance; showing multiple glyphs with
        one invocation of a text-showing operator such as Tj produces the same results as
        showing them with a separate invocation for each glyph. However, the perfor-
      mance of text searching (and other text extraction operations) is signiﬁcantly
      better if the text strings are as long as possible and are shown in natural reading
      order.
5.3.3 Text Space Details
      As stated in Section 5.3.1, “Text-Positioning Operators,” text is shown in text
      space, which is deﬁned by the combination of the text matrix, Tm , and the text
      state parameters Tfs , Th , and Trise . This determines how text coordinates are
      transformed into user space. Both the glyph’s shape and its displacement (hori-
      zontal or vertical) are interpreted in text space.
      Note: Glyphs are actually deﬁned in glyph space, whose deﬁnition varies according
      to the font type as discussed in Section 5.1.3, “Glyph Positioning and Metrics.” Glyph
      coordinates are ﬁrst transformed from glyph space to text space before being subject-
      ed to the transformations described below.
      The entire transformation from text space to device space can be represented by a
      text rendering matrix, Trm :
                    T fs × T h        0    0
          T rm =         0           T fs 0      × T m × CTM
                         0          T rise 1
      Trm is a temporary matrix; conceptually, it is recomputed before each glyph is
      painted during a text-showing operation.
      After the glyph is painted, the text matrix is updated according to the glyph dis-
      placement and any spacing parameters that apply. First, a combined displace-
      ment is computed, denoted by either tx (in horizontal writing mode) or ty (in
      vertical writing mode); the variable corresponding to the other writing mode is
      set to 0.

          t x =   w0 – ----------  × T fs + T c + T w  × T h

      w0 and w1 are the glyph’s horizontal and vertical displacements
      Tj is a position adjustment speciﬁed by a number in a TJ array, if any
      Tfs and Th are the current text font size and horizontal scaling parameters in
      the graphics state
      Tc and Tw are the current character and word spacing parameters in the graph-
      ics state, if applicable
    The text matrix is then updated as follows:
                   1  0 0
       Tm =        0  1 0     × Tm
                   tx ty 1
5.4 Introduction to Font Data Structures
    A font is represented in PDF as a dictionary specifying the type of font, its Post-
    Script name, its encoding, and information that can be used to provide a substi-
    tute when the font program is not available. Optionally, the font program itself
    can be embedded as a stream object in the PDF ﬁle.
    The font types are distinguished by the Subtype entry in the font dictionary.
    Table 5.7 lists the font types deﬁned in PDF. Type 0 fonts are called composite
    fonts; other types of font are called simple fonts. In addition to fonts, PDF sup-
    ports two classes of font-related objects, called CIDFonts and CMaps, described
    in Section 5.6.1, “CID-Keyed Fonts Overview.” CIDFonts are listed in Table 5.7
    because, like fonts, they are collections of glyphs; however, a CIDFont is never
    used directly, but only as a component of a Type 0 font.
    For all font types, the term font dictionary refers to a PDF dictionary containing
    information about the font; likewise, a CIDFont dictionary contains information
    about a CIDFont. Except for Type 3, this dictionary is distinct from the font pro-
    gram that deﬁnes the font’s glyphs. That font program may be embedded in the
    PDF ﬁle as a stream object or be obtained from some external source.

              MMType1              A multiple master font—an extension of the Type 1 font that allows the gen-
                                   eration of a wide variety of typeface styles from a single font (see “Multiple
                                   Master Fonts” on page 319)
Type 3        Type3                A font that deﬁnes glyphs with streams of PDF graphics operators (see Sec-

         Note: This terminology differs from that used in the PostScript language. In Post-
         Script, a font dictionary is a PostScript data structure that is created as a direct result
         of interpreting a font program. In PDF, a font program is always treated as if it were
         a separate ﬁle, even if its contents are embedded in the PDF ﬁle. The font program is
         interpreted by a specialized font interpreter when necessary; its contents never mate-
         rialize as PDF objects.
         Most font programs (and related programs, such as CIDFonts and CMaps) con-
         form to external speciﬁcations, such as the Adobe Type 1 Font Format. This book
         does not include those speciﬁcations. See the Bibliography for more information
         about the speciﬁcations mentioned in this chapter.
         The most predictable and dependable results are produced when all font
         programs used to show text are embedded in the PDF ﬁle. The following sections
         describe precisely how to do so. On the other hand, if a PDF ﬁle refers to font
         programs that are not embedded, the results depend on the availability of fonts in
         the viewer application’s environment. The following sections specify some con-
      ventions for referring to external font programs; however, some details of font
      naming, font substitution, and glyph selection are implementation-dependent
      and may vary among different viewer applications and operating system environ-
      ments.
 5.5 Simple Fonts
      There are several types of simple font, all of which have the following properties:
      • Glyphs in the font are selected by single-byte character codes obtained from a
        string that is shown by the text-showing operators. Logically, these codes index
        into a table of 256 glyphs; the mapping from codes to glyphs is called the font’s
        encoding. Each font program has a built-in encoding. Under some circum-
        stances, the encoding can be altered by means described in Section 5.5.5,
        “Character Encoding.”
      • Each glyph has a single set of metrics, including a horizontal displacement or
        width, as described in Section 5.1.3, “Glyph Positioning and Metrics.” That is,
        simple fonts support only horizontal writing mode.
      • Except for Type 3 fonts and certain standard Type 1 fonts, every font dictionary
        contains a subsidiary dictionary, the font descriptor, containing fontwide
        metrics and other attributes of the font; see Section 5.7, “Font Descriptors.”
        Among those attributes is an optional font ﬁle stream containing the font pro-
        gram itself.
5.5.1 Type 1 Fonts
      A Type 1 font program is a stylized PostScript program that describes glyph
      shapes. It uses a compact encoding for the glyph descriptions, and it includes
      hint information that enables high-quality rendering even at small sizes and low
      resolutions. Details on this format are provided in a separate book, Adobe Type 1
      Font Format. An alternative, more compact but functionally equivalent represen-
      tation of a Type 1 font program is documented in Adobe Technical Note #5176,
      The Compact Font Format Speciﬁcation.
      Note: Although a Type 1 font program uses PostScript language syntax, using it does
      not require a full PostScript interpreter; a specialized Type 1 font interpreter sufﬁces.
          A Type 1 font dictionary contains the entries listed in Table 5.8. Some entries are
          optional for the standard 14 fonts listed under “Standard Type 1 Fonts” on page
          319, but are required otherwise.

Standard Type 1 Fonts
The PostScript names of 14 Type 1 fonts, known as the standard fonts, are as
follows:
     Times−Roman         Helvetica               Courier               Symbol
     Times−Bold          Helvetica−Bold          Courier−Bold          ZapfDingbats
     Times−Italic        Helvetica−Oblique       Courier−Oblique
     Times−BoldItalic    Helvetica−BoldOblique   Courier−BoldOblique
These fonts, or their font metrics and suitable substitution fonts, are guaranteed
to be available to the viewer application. The character sets and encodings for
these fonts are given in Appendix D. The Adobe font metrics (AFM) ﬁles for the
standard 14 fonts are available from the ASN Developer Program Web site (see
the Bibliography). For more information on font metrics, see Adobe Technical
Note #5004, Adobe Font Metrics File Format Speciﬁcation.
Ordinarily, a font dictionary that refers to one of the standard fonts should omit
the FirstChar, LastChar, Widths, and FontDescriptor entries. However, it is per-
missible to override a standard font by including these entries and embedding the
font program in the PDF ﬁle. (See implementation note 44 in Appendix H.)
Multiple Master Fonts
The multiple master font format is an extension of the Type 1 font format that al-
lows the generation of a wide variety of typeface styles from a single font pro-
gram. This is accomplished through the presence of various design dimensions in
the font. Examples of design dimensions are weight (light to extra-bold) and
width (condensed to expanded). Coordinates along these design dimensions
(such as the degree of boldness) are speciﬁed by numbers. A particular choice of
numbers selects an instance of the multiple master font. Adobe Technical Note
#5015, Type 1 Font Format Supplement, describes multiple master fonts in detail.
The font dictionary for a multiple master font instance has the same entries as a
Type 1 font dictionary (Table 5.8 on page 317), except note the following:
• The value of Subtype is MMType1.
• If the PostScript name of the instance contains spaces, the spaces are replaced
  by underscores in the value of BaseFont. For instance, as illustrated in Example
  5.7, the name “MinionMM 366 465 11 ” (which ends with a space character)
  becomes /MinionMM_366_465_11_.

This example illustrates a convention for including the numeric values of the
design coordinates as part of the instance’s BaseFont name. This convention is
commonly used for accessing multiple master font instances from an external
source in the viewer application’s environment; it is documented in Adobe Tech-
nical Note #5088, Font Naming Issues. However, this convention is not prescribed
as part of the PDF speciﬁcation. In particular, if the font program for this in-
      stance is embedded in the PDF ﬁle, it must be an ordinary Type 1 font program,
      not a multiple master font program. This font program is called a snapshot of the
      multiple master font instance, incorporating the chosen values of the design co-
      ordinates.
5.5.2 TrueType Fonts
      The TrueType font format was developed by Apple Computer, Inc., and has been
      adopted as a standard font format for the Microsoft Windows operating system.
      Speciﬁcations for the TrueType font ﬁle format are available in Apple’s TrueType
      Reference Manual and Microsoft’s TrueType 1.0 Font Files Technical Speciﬁcation.
      Note: A TrueType font program can be embedded directly in a PDF ﬁle as a stream
      object. The Type 42 font format that is deﬁned for PostScript does not apply to PDF.
      A TrueType font dictionary can contain the same entries as a Type 1 font diction-
      ary (Table 5.8 on page 317), except note the following:
      • The value of Subtype is TrueType.
      • The value of BaseFont is derived differently, as described below.
      • The value of Encoding is subject to limitations that are described in Section
         5.5.5, “Character Encoding.”
      The PostScript name for the value of BaseFont is determined in one of two ways:
      • Use the PostScript name that is an optional entry in the “name” table of the
         TrueType font itself.
      • In the absence of such an entry in the “name” table, derive a PostScript name
         from the name by which the font is known in the host operating system: on a
         Windows system, it is based on the lfFaceName ﬁeld in a LOGFONT structure; in
         the Mac OS, it is based on the name of the FOND resource. If the name contains
         any spaces, the spaces are removed.
      If the font in a source document uses a bold or italic style, but there is no font
      data for that style, the host operating system will synthesize the style. In this case,
      a comma and the style name (one of Bold, Italic, or BoldItalic) are appended to the
      font name. For example, for a TrueType font that is a bold variant of the New
      York font, the BaseFont value is written as /NewYork,Bold (as illustrated in
      Example 5.8).

         endobj
      Note that for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) fonts, the host font system’s
      “font name” is often encoded in the host operating system’s script. For instance, a
      Japanese font may have a name that is written in Japanese using some (unidenti-
      ﬁed) Japanese encoding. Thus, TrueType font names may contain multiple-byte
      character codes, each of which requires multiple characters to represent in a PDF
      name object (using the # notation to quote special characters as needed).
5.5.3 Font Subsets
      PDF 1.1 permits documents to include subsets of Type 1 and TrueType fonts.
      The font and font descriptor that describe a font subset are slightly different
      from those of ordinary fonts. These differences allow an application to recog-
      nize font subsets and to merge documents containing different subsets of the
      same font. (For more information on font descriptors, see Section 5.7, “Font
      Descriptors.”)
      For a font subset, the PostScript name of the font—the value of the font’s
      BaseFont entry and the font descriptor’s FontName entry—begins with a tag
           followed by a plus sign (+). The tag consists of exactly six uppercase letters; the
           choice of letters is arbitrary, but different subsets in the same PDF ﬁle must have
           different tags. For example, EOODIA+Poetica is the name of a subset of Poetica®, a
           Type 1 font. (See implementation note 45 in Appendix H.)
  5.5.4 Type 3 Fonts
           Type 3 fonts differ from the other fonts supported by PDF. A Type 3 font diction-
           ary deﬁnes the font itself, while the other font dictionaries simply contain infor-
           mation about the font and refer to a separate font program for the actual glyph
           descriptions. In Type 3 fonts, glyphs are deﬁned by streams of PDF graphics
           operators. These streams are associated with character names. A separate encod-
           ing entry maps character codes to the appropriate character names for the glyphs.
           Type 3 fonts are more ﬂexible than Type 1 fonts, because the glyph descriptions
           may contain arbitrary PDF graphics operators. However, Type 3 fonts have no
           hinting mechanism for improving output at small sizes or low resolutions. A
           Type 3 font dictionary contains the entries listed in Table 5.9.

          For each character shown by a text-showing operator using a Type 3 font, the
          viewer application does the following:
          1. Looks up the character code in the font’s Encoding entry, as described in Sec-
             tion 5.5.5, “Character Encoding,” to obtain a character name.
2. Looks up the character name in the font’s CharProcs dictionary to obtain a
   stream object containing a glyph description. (If the name is not present as a
   key in CharProcs, no glyph is painted.)
3. Invokes the glyph description, as described below. The graphics state is saved
   before this invocation and restored afterward, so any changes the glyph de-
   scription makes to the graphics state do not persist after it ﬁnishes.
When the glyph description begins execution, the current transformation matrix
(CTM) is the concatenation of the font matrix (FontMatrix in the current font
dictionary) and the text space that was in effect at the time the text-showing op-
erator was invoked (see Section 5.3.3, “Text Space Details”). This means that
shapes described in the glyph coordinate system will be transformed into the user
coordinate system and will appear in the appropriate size and orientation on the
page. The glyph description should describe the glyph in terms of absolute coor-
dinates in the glyph coordinate system, placing the glyph origin at (0, 0) in this
space. It should make no assumptions about the initial text position.
Aside from the CTM, the graphics state is inherited from the environment of the
text-showing operator that caused the glyph description to be invoked. To ensure
predictable results, the glyph description must initialize any graphics state
parameters on which it depends. In particular, if it invokes the S (stroke) opera-
tor, it should explicitly set the line width, line join, line cap, and dash pattern to
appropriate values. Normally, it is unnecessary and undesirable to initialize the
current color parameter, because the text-showing operators are designed to
paint glyphs with the current color.
The glyph description must execute one of the operators described in Table 5.10
to pass width and bounding box information to the font machinery. This must
precede the execution of any path construction or path-painting operators de-
scribing the glyph.
Note: Type 3 fonts in PDF are very similar to those in PostScript. Some of the in-
formation provided in Type 3 font dictionaries and glyph descriptions, while seem-
ingly redundant or unnecessary, is nevertheless required for correct results when a
PDF viewer application prints to a PostScript output device. This applies particu-
larly to the operands of the d0 and d1 operators, which in PostScript are named
setcharwidth and setcachedevice. For further explanation, see Section 5.7 of the
PostScript Language Reference, Third Edition.
                               TABLE 5.10 Type 3 font operators
OPERANDS              OPERATOR  DESCRIPTION
wx wy                    d0     Set width information for the glyph and declare that the glyph descrip-
                                tion speciﬁes both its shape and its color. (Note that this operator name
                                ends in the digit 0.) wx speciﬁes the horizontal displacement in the glyph
                                coordinate system; it must be consistent with the corresponding width
                                in the font’s Widths array. wy must be 0 (see Section 5.1.3, “Glyph Posi-
                                tioning and Metrics”).
                                This operator is permitted only in a content stream appearing in a
                                Type 3 font’s CharProcs dictionary. It is typically used only if the glyph
                                description executes operators to set the color explicitly.
wx wy llx lly urx ury    d1     Set width and bounding box information for the glyph and declare that
                                the glyph description speciﬁes only shape, not color. (Note that this
                                operator name ends in the digit 1.) wx speciﬁes the horizontal displace-
                                ment in the glyph coordinate system; it must be consistent with the
                                corresponding width in the font’s Widths array. wy must be 0 (see Sec-
                                tion 5.1.3, “Glyph Positioning and Metrics”).
                                llx and lly are the coordinates of the lower-left corner, and urx and ury the
                                upper-right corner, of the glyph bounding box. The glyph bounding box
                                is the smallest rectangle, oriented with the axes of the glyph coordinate
                                system, that completely encloses all marks placed on the page as a result
                                of executing the glyph’s description. The declared bounding box must be
                                correct—in other words, sufﬁciently large to enclose the entire glyph. If
                                any marks fall outside this bounding box, the result is unpredictable.
                                A glyph description that begins with the d1 operator should not execute
                                any operators that set the color (or other color-related parameters) in
                                the graphics state; any use of such operators will be ignored. The glyph
                                description is executed solely to determine the glyph’s shape; its color is
                                determined by the graphics state in effect each time this glyph is painted
                                by a text-showing operator. For the same reason, the glyph description
                                may not include an image; however, an image mask is acceptable, since it
                                merely deﬁnes a region of the page to be painted with the current color.
                                This operator is permitted only in a content stream appearing in a
                                Type 3 font’s CharProcs dictionary.
Example of a Type 3 Font
Example 5.9 shows the deﬁnition of a Type 3 font with only two glyphs—a ﬁlled
square and a ﬁlled triangle, selected by the characters a and b. Figure 5.12 shows
the result of showing the string (ababab) using this font.

5.5.5 Character Encoding
      A font’s encoding is the association between character codes (obtained from text
      strings that are shown) and glyph descriptions. This section describes the charac-
      ter encoding scheme used with simple PDF fonts. Composite fonts (Type 0) use a
      different character mapping algorithm, as discussed in Section 5.6, “Composite
      Fonts.”
      Except for Type 3 fonts, every font program has a built-in encoding. Under cer-
      tain circumstances, a PDF font dictionary can change a font’s built-in encoding
      to match the requirements of the application generating the text being shown.
      This ﬂexibility in character encoding is valuable for two reasons:
      • It permits showing text that is encoded according to any of the various existing
        conventions. For example, the Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS oper-
   ating systems use different standard encodings for Latin text, and many appli-
   cations use their own special-purpose encodings.
• It allows applications to specify how characters selected from a large character
   set are to be encoded. Some character sets consist of more than 256 characters,
   including ligatures, accented characters, and other symbols required for high-
   quality typography or non-Latin writing systems. Different encodings can se-
   lect different subsets of the same character set.
Latin-text font programs produced by Adobe Systems use the Adobe standard
encoding, often referred to as StandardEncoding. The name StandardEncoding
has no special meaning in PDF, but this encoding does play a role as a default en-
coding (as shown in Table 5.11 below). The regular encodings used for Latin-text
fonts on Windows and Mac OS systems are named MacRomanEncoding and
WinAnsiEncoding, respectively. Additionally, an encoding named MacExpert-
Encoding is used with “expert” fonts that contain additional characters useful for
sophisticated typography. Complete details of these encodings and of the charac-
ters present in typical fonts are provided in Appendix D.
In PDF, a font is classiﬁed as either nonsymbolic or symbolic according to whether
or not all of its characters are members of the Adobe standard Latin character set.
This is indicated by ﬂags in the font descriptor; see Section 5.7.1, “Font Descrip-
tor Flags.” Symbolic fonts contain other character sets, to which the encodings
mentioned above ordinarily do not apply. Such font programs have built-in en-
codings that are usually unique to each font. The standard 14 fonts include two
symbolic fonts, Symbol and ZapfDingbats, whose encodings and character sets
are documented in Appendix D.
A font program’s built-in encoding can be overridden or altered by including an
Encoding entry in the PDF font dictionary. The possible encoding modiﬁcations
depend on the font type, as discussed below. The value of the Encoding entry is
either a named encoding (the name of one of the predeﬁned encodings Mac-
RomanEncoding, MacExpertEncoding, or WinAnsiEncoding) or an encoding dic-
tionary. An encoding dictionary contains the entries listed in Table 5.11.

By convention, the name .notdef can be used to indicate that there is no character
name associated with a given character code.
Encodings for Type 1 Fonts
A Type 1 font program’s glyph descriptions are keyed by character names, not by
character codes. Character names are ordinary PDF name objects. Descriptions of
Latin alphabetic characters are normally associated with names consisting of
single letters, such as A or a. Other characters are associated with names com-
posed of words, such as three, ampersand, or parenleft. A Type 1 font’s built-in
encoding is deﬁned by an Encoding array that is part of the font program itself;
this is not to be confused with the Encoding entry in the PDF font dictionary.
An Encoding entry can alter a Type 1 font’s mapping from character codes to
character names. The Differences array can map a code to the name of any glyph
description that exists in the font program, whether or not that glyph is refer-
enced by the font’s built-in encoding or by the encoding speciﬁed in the
BaseEncoding entry.
All Type 1 font programs contain an actual glyph for the character named
.notdef. The effect produced by showing the .notdef character is at the discretion
of the font designer; in Type 1 font programs produced by Adobe, it is the same
as the space character. If an encoding maps to a character name that does not ex-
ist in the Type 1 font program, the .notdef character is substituted.
Encodings for Type 3 Fonts
A Type 3 font, like Type 1, contains glyph descriptions that are keyed by character
names; in this case, they appear as explicit keys in the font’s CharProcs dictionary.
A Type 3 font’s mapping from character codes to character names is entirely de-
ﬁned by its Encoding entry, which is required in this case.
Encodings for TrueType Fonts
A TrueType font program’s built-in encoding maps directly from character codes
to glyph descriptions, using an internal data structure called a “cmap” (not to be
confused with the CMap described in Section 5.6.4, “CMaps”). A TrueType font
program can contain multiple encodings that are intended for use on different
platforms (such as Mac OS and Windows). The PDF font dictionary’s Encoding
entry can select among the available encodings; in the absence of this entry, an
implementation-dependent encoding is chosen.
There is no standard support for named characters in TrueType, although some
font programs have an optional “post” table listing character names for the
glyphs. If the viewer application needs to select glyph descriptions by name in a
font program lacking a “post” table, it translates from character names to codes
in one of the encodings given in the font program’s “cmap” table.
Because some aspects of TrueType glyph selection are dependent on the viewer
implementation or the operating system, PDF ﬁles that use TrueType fonts
should follow certain guidelines to ensure predictable behavior across all viewer
applications. The font program should be embedded. A nonsymbolic font should
specify MacRomanEncoding or WinAnsiEncoding as the value of its Encoding en-
try, with no Differences array. A symbolic font should not specify an Encoding
entry; its font program’s “cmap” table should contain exactly one encoding. See
below for speciﬁc guidelines on the contents of this “cmap” table.
Note: Some popular TrueType font programs contain incorrect encoding informa-
tion. Implementations of TrueType font interpreters have evolved heuristics for deal-
ing with such problems; those heuristics are not described here. For maximum
portability, only well-formed TrueType font programs should be used in PDF ﬁles.
The following paragraphs describe the treatment of TrueType font encodings be-
ginning with PDF 1.3, as implemented in Acrobat 4.0 and later viewers. This in-
formation does not necessarily apply to earlier versions or implementations.
A TrueType font program’s “cmap” table consists of one or more subtables, each
identiﬁed by the combination of a platform ID and a platform-speciﬁc encoding ID.
If a named encoding (WinAnsiEncoding, MacRomanEncoding, or MacExpert-
Encoding) is speciﬁed in a font dictionary’s Encoding entry or in an encoding dic-
tionary’s BaseEncoding entry, a “cmap” subtable is selected and used as described
below.
• If a “cmap” subtable with platform ID 3 and encoding ID 1 (Microsoft Uni-
   code) is present, it is used as follows: A character code is ﬁrst mapped to a char-
   acter name as speciﬁed by the font’s Encoding entry. The character name is
   then mapped to a Unicode value by consulting the Adobe Glyph List (see the
   Bibliography). Finally, the Unicode value is mapped to a glyph description
   according to the (3, 1) subtable.
• If a “cmap” subtable with platform ID 1 and encoding 0 (Macintosh Roman) is
   present, it is used as follows: A character code is ﬁrst mapped to a character
   name as speciﬁed by the font’s Encoding entry. The character name is then
   mapped back to a character code according to MacRomanEncoding (see Appen-
   dix D). Finally, the code is mapped to a glyph description according to the (1, 0)
   subtable.
    • In either of the cases above, if the character name cannot be mapped as speci-
       ﬁed, the character name is looked up in the font program’s “post” table (if one
       is present) and the associated glyph description is used.
    If no Encoding entry is speciﬁed in the font dictionary, the “cmap” subtable with
    platform ID 1 and encoding 0 will be used to map directly from character codes
    to glyph descriptions, without any consideration of character names. This is the
    normal convention for symbolic fonts.
    If a character cannot be mapped in any of the ways described above, the results
    are implementation-dependent.
5.6 Composite Fonts
    A composite font is one whose glyphs are obtained from other fonts or from font-
    like objects called CIDFonts, organized hierarchically. In PDF, a composite font is
    represented by a font dictionary whose Subtype value is Type0; this is also called
    a Type 0 font. The Type 0 font at the top level of the hierarchy is the root font.
    Fonts and CIDFonts immediately below a Type 0 font are called its descendants.
    The Type 0 font immediately above a descendant is called its parent font.
    When the current font is composite, the text-showing operators behave different-
    ly than with simple fonts. Whereas for simple fonts each byte of a string to be
    shown selects one character, for composite fonts a sequence of one or more bytes
    can be decoded to select a character from any of the descendant fonts or
    CIDFonts. This facility supports the use of very large character sets, such as those
    for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. It also simpliﬁes the organiza-
    tion of fonts that have complex encoding requirements.
    PDF 1.2 introduces a general architecture for composite fonts that theoretically
    allows a Type 0 font to have multiple descendants, which might themselves be
    Type 0 fonts. However, in versions up to and including PDF 1.4, only a single
    descendant is allowed, which must be a CIDFont (not a font). This restriction
    may be relaxed in a future PDF version.
    Note: Composite fonts in PDF are analogous to composite fonts in PostScript, but
    with some limitations. In particular, PDF requires that the character encoding be de-
    ﬁned by a CMap (described below), which is only one of several encoding methods
    available in PostScript.
      This section ﬁrst introduces the architecture of CID-keyed fonts, which are the
      only kind of composite font supported in PDF. Then it describes the CIDFont
      and CMap dictionaries, which are the PDF objects that represent the correspond-
      ingly named components of a CID-keyed font. Finally, it describes the Type 0
      font dictionary, which combines a CIDFont and a CMap to produce a font whose
      glyphs can be accessed by means of variable-length character codes in a string to
      be shown.
5.6.1 CID-Keyed Fonts Overview
      CID-keyed fonts provide a convenient and efﬁcient method for deﬁning
      multiple-byte character encodings, fonts with a large number of glyphs, and fonts
      that incorporate glyphs obtained from other fonts. These capabilities provide
      great ﬂexibility for representing text in writing systems for languages with large
      character sets, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK).
      The CID-keyed font architecture speciﬁes the external representation of certain
      font programs, called CMap and CIDFont ﬁles, along with some conventions for
      combining and using those ﬁles. This architecture is independent of PDF; CID-
      keyed fonts can be used in other environments. For complete documentation on
      the architecture and the ﬁle formats, see Adobe Technical Notes #5092, CID-
      Keyed Font Technology Overview, and #5014, Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files
      Speciﬁcation. This section describes only the PDF objects that represent these font
      programs.
      The term CID-keyed font reﬂects the fact that CID (character identiﬁer) numbers
      are used to index and access the glyph descriptions in the font. This method is
      more efﬁcient for large fonts than the method of accessing by character name, as
      is used for some simple fonts. CIDs range from 0 to a maximum value that is sub-
      ject to an implementation limit (see Appendix C).
      A character collection is an ordered set of all characters needed to support one or
      more popular character sets for a particular language. The order of the characters
      in the character collection determines the CID number for each character. Each
      CID-keyed font must explicitly reference the character collection on which its
      CID numbers are based; see Section 5.6.2, “CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries.”
      A CMap (character map) ﬁle speciﬁes the correspondence between character
      codes and the CID numbers used to identify characters. It is equivalent to the
      concept of an encoding in simple fonts. Whereas a simple font allows a maximum
      of 256 characters to be encoded and accessible at one time, a CMap can describe a
      mapping from multiple-byte codes to thousands of characters in a large CID-
      keyed font. For example, it can describe Shift-JIS, one of several widely used en-
      codings for Japanese, or Unicode, an international standard encoding that covers
      many languages.
      A CMap can reference an entire character collection, a subset, or multiple charac-
      ter collections. It can also reference characters in other fonts by character code or
      character name. The CMap mapping yields a font number and a character selector
      that can be a CID, a character code, or a character name. Furthermore, a CMap
      can incorporate another CMap by reference, without having to duplicate it.
      These features enable character collections to be combined or supplemented, and
      make all the constituent characters accessible to text-showing operations through
      a single encoding.
      Note: As mentioned earlier, PDF versions up to and including PDF 1.4 do not sup-
      port the entire CID-keyed font architecture. In PDF, a CID-keyed font may have
      only a single descendant, whose characters must be referenced by CID.
      A CIDFont ﬁle contains the glyph descriptions for a character collection. The
      glyph descriptions themselves are typically in a format similar to those used in
      simple fonts, such as Type 1. However, they are identiﬁed by CIDs rather than by
      names, and they are organized differently.
      In PDF, the CMap and CIDFont are represented by PDF objects, which are de-
      scribed below. The CMap and CIDFont programs themselves can be either refer-
      enced by name or embedded as stream objects in the PDF ﬁle. As stated earlier,
      the external ﬁle formats are not documented here, but in Adobe Technical Note
      #5014, Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Speciﬁcation.
      A CID-keyed font, then, is the combination of a CMap with one or more
      CIDFonts, simple fonts, or composite fonts containing glyph descriptions. In
      PDF, a CID-keyed font is represented as a Type 0 font. It contains an Encoding
      entry whose value is a CMap dictionary, and its DescendantFonts array refer-
      ences the CIDFont or font dictionaries with which the CMap has been combined.
5.6.2 CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries
      CIDFont and CMap dictionaries contain a CIDSystemInfo entry specifying the
      character collection assumed by the CIDFont or by each CIDFont associated with
         the CMap—that is, the interpretation of the CID numbers used by the CIDFont.
         A character collection is uniquely identiﬁed by the Registry, Ordering, and
         Supplement entries in the CIDSystemInfo dictionary, as described in Table 5.12.
         Character collections whose Registry and Ordering values are the same are com-
         patible.

                                                                                                    ter collection has a supplement number of 0. Whenever additional CIDs are
                                                                                                    assigned in a character collection, the supplement number is increased. Supple-
                                                                                                    ments do not alter the ordering of existing CIDs in the character collection. This
                                                                                                    value is not used in determining compatibility between character collections.
         In a CIDFont, the CIDSystemInfo entry is a dictionary that speciﬁes the
         CIDFont’s character collection. Note that the CIDFont need not contain glyph
         descriptions for all the CIDs in a collection; it can contain a subset. In a CMap,
         the CIDSystemInfo entry is either a single dictionary or an array of dictionaries,
         depending on whether it associates codes with a single character collection or
         with multiple character collections; see Section 5.6.4, “CMaps.”
         For proper behavior, the CIDSystemInfo entry of a CMap should be compatible
         with that of the CIDFont or CIDFonts with which it is used. If they are incompat-
         ible, the effects produced will be unpredictable.
  5.6.3 CIDFonts
         A CIDFont program contains glyph descriptions that are accessed using a CID as
         the character selector. There are two types of CIDFont. A Type 0 CIDFont con-
         tains glyph descriptions based on Adobe’s Type 1 font format, whereas those in a
         Type 2 CIDFont are based on the TrueType font format.
          A CIDFont dictionary is a PDF object that contains information about a
          CIDFont program. Although its Type value is Font, a CIDFont is not actually a
          font. It does not have an Encoding entry, it cannot be listed in the Font subdic-
          tionary of a resource dictionary, and it cannot be used as the operand of the Tf
          operator. It is used only as a descendant of a Type 0 font. The CMap in the Type 0
          font is what deﬁnes the encoding that maps character codes to CIDs in the
          CIDFont. Table 5.13 lists the entries in a CIDFont dictionary.
                                TABLE 5.13 Entries in a CIDFont dictionary

BaseFont                                name                                                        (Required) The PostScript name of the CIDFont. For Type 0 CIDFonts, this
                                                                                                    is usually the value of the CIDFontName entry in the CIDFont program. For

                                                                                                    Type font program is embedded in the PDF ﬁle (see the next section).
         Glyph Selection in CIDFonts
         Type 0 and Type 2 CIDFonts handle the mapping from CIDs to glyph descrip-
         tions in somewhat different ways.
         For Type 0, the CIDFont program itself contains glyph descriptions that are iden-
         tiﬁed by CIDs. The CIDFont program identiﬁes the character collection by a
         CIDSystemInfo dictionary, which should simply be copied into the PDF CIDFont
         dictionary. CIDs are interpreted uniformly in all CIDFont programs supporting a
         given character collection, whether the program is embedded in the PDF ﬁle or
         obtained from an external source.
         For Type 2, the CIDFont program is actually a TrueType font program, which has
         no native notion of CIDs. In a TrueType font program, glyph descriptions are
         identiﬁed by glyph index values. Glyph indices are internal to the font and are not
         deﬁned consistently from one font to another. Instead, a TrueType font program
         contains a “cmap” table that provides mappings directly from character codes to
         glyph indices for one or more predeﬁned encodings.
         TrueType font programs are integrated with the CID-keyed font architecture in
         one of two ways, depending on whether the font program is embedded in the
         PDF ﬁle.
         • If the TrueType font program is embedded, the Type 2 CIDFont dictionary
            must contain a CIDToGIDMap entry that maps CIDs to the glyph indices for the
            appropriate glyph descriptions in that font program.
         • If the TrueType font program is not embedded but is referenced by name, the
            Type 2 CIDFont dictionary must not contain a CIDToGIDMap entry, since it is
            not meaningful to refer to glyph indices in an external font program. In this
  case, CIDs do not participate in glyph selection, and only predeﬁned CMaps
  may be used with this CIDFont (see Section 5.6.4, “CMaps”). The viewer appli-
  cation selects glyphs by translating characters from the encoding speciﬁed by
  the predeﬁned CMap to one of the encodings given in the TrueType font’s
  “cmap” table. The means by which this is accomplished are implementation-
  dependent.
Even though the CIDs are sometimes not used to select glyphs in a Type 2
CIDFont, they are always used to determine the glyph metrics, as described in the
next section.
Every CIDFont must contain a glyph description for CID 0, which is analogous
to the .notdef character name in simple fonts (see “Handling Undeﬁned Charac-
ters” on page 355).
Glyph Metrics in CIDFonts
As discussed in Section 5.1.3, “Glyph Positioning and Metrics,” the width of a
glyph refers to the horizontal displacement between the origin of the glyph and
the origin of the next glyph when writing in horizontal mode. In this mode, the
vertical displacement between origins is always 0. Widths for a CIDFont are de-
ﬁned using the DW and W entries in the CIDFont dictionary. These widths must
be consistent with the actual widths given in the CIDFont program itself. (See
implementation note 43 in Appendix H.)
The DW entry deﬁnes the default width, which is used for all glyphs whose widths
are not speciﬁed individually. This entry is particularly useful for Chinese, Japa-
nese, and Korean fonts, in which many of the glyphs have the same width.
The W array allows the deﬁnition of widths for individual CIDs. The elements of
the array are organized in groups of two or three, where each group is in one of
the following two formats:
    c [w1 w2 … wn ]
    cﬁrst clast w
In the ﬁrst format, c is an integer specifying a starting CID value; it is followed by
an array of n numbers that specify the widths for n consecutive CIDs, starting
with c. The second format deﬁnes the same width, w, for all CIDs in the range
cﬁrst to clast .
The following is an example of a W entry:
    /W [ 120 [400 325 500]
           7080 8032 1000
         ]
In this example, the glyphs for the characters having CIDs 120, 121, and 122 are
400, 325, and 500 units wide, respectively. CIDs in the range 7080 through 8032
all have a width of 1000 units.
Glyphs from a CIDFont can be shown in vertical writing mode. (This is selected
by the WMode entry in the associated CMap dictionary; see Section 5.6.4,
“CMaps.”) To be used in this way, the CIDFont must deﬁne the vertical dis-
placement for each glyph and the position vector that relates the horizontal and
vertical writing origins.
The default position vector and vertical displacement vector are speciﬁed by the
DW2 entry in the CIDFont dictionary. DW2 is an array of two values: the vertical
component of the position vector v and the vertical component of the displace-
ment vector w1 (see Figure 5.5 on page 300). The horizontal component of the
position vector is always half the glyph width, and that of the displacement vector
is always 0. For example, if the DW2 entry is
    /DW2 [880 −1000]
then a glyph’s position vector and vertical displacement vector are
      v = (w0 ÷ 2, 880)
    w1 = (0, – 1000)
where w0 is the width (horizontal displacement) for the same glyph. Note that a
negative value for the vertical component will place the origin of the next glyph
below the current glyph, because vertical coordinates in a standard coordinate
system increase from bottom to top.
The W2 array allows the deﬁnition of vertical metrics for individual CIDs. The
elements of the array are organized in groups of two or ﬁve, where each group is
in one of the following two formats:
    c [w11y v1x v1y w12y v2x v2y …]
    cﬁrst clast w11y v1x v1y
      In the ﬁrst format, c is a starting CID and is followed by an array containing
      numbers interpreted in groups of three. Each group consists of the vertical com-
      ponent of the vertical displacement vector w1 (whose horizontal component is
      always 0) followed by the horizontal and vertical components for the position
      vector v. Successive groups deﬁne the vertical metrics for consecutive CIDs start-
      ing with c. The second format deﬁnes a range of CIDs from cﬁrst to clast , followed
      by three numbers that deﬁne the vertical metrics for all CIDs in this range. For
      example:
         /W2 [ 120 [−1000 250 772]
                7080 8032 −1000 500 900
              ]
      This W2 entry deﬁnes the vertical displacement vector for the character with CID
      120 as (0, −1000) and the position vector as (250, 772). It also deﬁnes the dis-
      placement vector for CIDs in the range 7080 through 8032 as (0, −1000) and the
      position vector as (500, 900).
5.6.4 CMaps
      As stated earlier, a CMap speciﬁes the mapping from character codes to character
      selectors (CIDs, character names, or character codes) in one or more associated
      fonts or CIDFonts. It serves a function analogous to the Encoding dictionary for
      a simple font. The CMap does not refer directly to speciﬁc fonts or CIDFonts;
      instead, it is combined with them as part of a CID-keyed font, represented in
      PDF as a Type 0 font dictionary (see Section 5.6.5, “Type 0 Font Dictionaries”).
      Within the CMap, the character mappings refer to the associated fonts or
      CIDFonts by font number, indexing from 0. All of the mappings for a particular
      font number must specify the same kind of character selector. If the character
      selectors are CIDs, the associated dictionary is expected to be a CIDFont. If the
      character selectors are names or codes, the associated dictionary is expected to be
      a font.
      Note: As mentioned earlier, PDF versions up to and including PDF 1.4 do not sup-
      port the entire CID-keyed font architecture. In PDF, a CID-keyed font may have
      only a single descendant, selected by font number 0, whose characters must be refer-
      enced by CID.
          A CMap also speciﬁes the writing mode—horizontal or vertical—for any
          CIDFont with which the CMap is combined. This determines which metrics are
          to be used when glyphs are painted from that font. (Writing mode is speciﬁed as
          part of the CMap because some glyphs have different shapes when written hori-
          zontally and vertically. In that case, the horizontal and vertical variants of a CMap
          specify different CIDs for a given character code.)
          A CMap may be speciﬁed in two ways:
          • As a name object identifying a predeﬁned CMap, whose deﬁnition is known to
            the viewer application.
          • As a stream object whose contents are a CMap ﬁle. (See implementation note
            48 in Appendix H.)
          Predeﬁned CMaps
          Table 5.14 lists the names of the predeﬁned CMaps. These CMaps map character
          codes to CIDs in a single descendant CIDFont. CMaps whose names end in H
          specify horizontal writing mode; those ending in V specify vertical writing mode.
          Note: Several of the CMaps deﬁne mappings from Unicode (UCS-2) encodings to
          character collections. Unicode values appearing in a text string are represented in
          “big-endian” order (high-order byte ﬁrst).

Generic
Identity−H            The horizontal identity mapping for 2-byte CIDs; may be used with CIDFonts using any
                      Registry, Ordering, and Supplement values. It maps 2-byte character codes ranging from
                      0 to 65,535 to the same 2-byte CID value, interpreted high-order byte ﬁrst (see below).
Identity−V            Vertical version of Identity−H. The mapping is the same as for Identity−H.
           The Identity−H and Identity−V CMaps can be used to refer to characters directly
           by their CIDs when showing a text string. When the current font is a Type 0 font
           whose Encoding entry is Identity−H or Identity−V, the string to be shown is inter-
           preted as pairs of bytes representing CIDs, high-order byte ﬁrst. This works with
           any CIDFont, independently of its character collection. Additionally, when used
           in conjunction with a Type 2 CIDFont whose CIDToGIDMap entry is Identity, the
           2-byte CIDs values in fact represent glyph indices for the glyph descriptions in
           the TrueType font program. This works only if the TrueType font program is em-
           bedded in the PDF ﬁle.
          Table 5.15 lists the character collections referenced by the predeﬁned CMaps for
          the different versions of PDF. A dash (—) indicates that the CMap is not pre-
          deﬁned in that PDF version.

          As noted in Section 5.6.2, “CIDSystemInfo Dictionaries,” a character collection is
          identiﬁed by registry, ordering, and supplement number, and supplements are
          cumulative; that is, a higher-numbered supplement includes the CIDs contained
          in lower-numbered supplements, as well as some additional CIDs. Consequently,
          text encoded according to the predeﬁned CMaps for a given PDF version will be
          valid when interpreted by a viewer application supporting the same or a later
          PDF version. When interpreted by a viewer supporting an earlier PDF version,
          such text will cause an error if a CMap is encountered that is not predeﬁned for
          that PDF version. If character codes are encountered that were added in a higher-
          numbered supplement than the one corresponding to the supported PDF ver-
          sion, no characters will be displayed for those codes; see “Handling Undeﬁned
          Characters” on page 355.
          Note: If an application producing a PDF ﬁle encounters text to be included that
          uses characters from a higher-numbered supplement than the one corresponding to
          the PDF version being generated, the application should embed the CMap for the
          higher-numbered supplement rather than refer to the predeﬁned CMap (see the
          next section).
          The CMap programs that deﬁne the predeﬁned CMaps are available through the
          ASN Developer Program Web site and are also provided in conjunction with the
          book CJKV Information Processing, by Ken Lunde. Details on the character collec-
tions, including sample glyphs for all the CIDs, can be found in a number of
Adobe Technical Notes; for more information about these Notes and the afore-
mentioned book, see the Bibliography.
Embedded CMap Files
For character encodings that are not predeﬁned, the PDF ﬁle must contain a
stream that deﬁnes the CMap. In addition to the standard entries for streams
(listed in Table 3.4 on page 38), the CMap stream dictionary contains the entries
listed in Table 5.16. The data in the stream deﬁnes the mapping from character
codes to a font number and a character selector. The data must follow the syntax
deﬁned in Adobe Technical Note #5014, Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Speciﬁ-
cation.
CMap Example and Operator Summary
The following example of a CMap stream object illustrates and partially explains
the contents of a CMap ﬁle. This is fully documented in Adobe Technical Note
#5014, Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Speciﬁcation. There are several reasons for
including this material here:
• It documents some restrictions on the contents of a CMap ﬁle that can be
   embedded in a PDF ﬁle.
• It provides background to aid in understanding subsequent material, particu-
   larly “CMap Mapping” on page 354.
• It is the basis for a PDF feature, the ToUnicode CMap, which is a minor exten-
   sion of the CMap ﬁle format. This extension is described in Section 5.9,
   “ToUnicode CMaps.”
Example 5.11 is a sample CMap for a Japanese Shift-JIS encoding. Character
codes in this encoding can be either 1 or 2 bytes in length. This CMap maps all
character codes to CIDs in font number 0. It could be used with a CIDFont that
uses the same CID ordering as speciﬁed in the CIDSystemInfo entry. Note that
several of the entries in the stream dictionary are also replicated in the stream
data itself.

As can be seen from this example, a CMap ﬁle conforms to PostScript language
syntax; however, a full PostScript interpreter is not needed to interpret it. Aside
from some required boilerplate, the CMap ﬁle consists of one or more occur-
rences of several special CMap construction operators, invoked in a speciﬁc
order. The following is a summary of these operators.
• begincmap and endcmap enclose the CMap deﬁnition.
• usecmap incorporates the code mappings from another CMap ﬁle. In PDF, the
  other CMap must also be identiﬁed in the UseCMap entry in the CMap dic-
  tionary (see Table 5.16 on page 349).
• begincodespacerange and endcodespacerange deﬁne codespace ranges—the
  valid input character code ranges—by specifying a pair of codes of some par-
  ticular length giving the lower and upper bounds of each range; see “CMap
  Mapping” on page 354.
      • usefont speciﬁes a font number that is an implicit operand of all the character
        code mapping operations that follow. In PDF versions up to and including
        PDF 1.4, the font number must be 0; since this is the default, usefont typically
        does not appear at all.
      • beginbfchar and endbfchar deﬁne mappings of individual input character
        codes to character codes or character names in the associated font. begin-
        bfrange and endbfrange do the same, but for ranges of input codes. In PDF
        versions up to and including PDF 1.4, these operators may not appear in a
        CMap that is used as the Encoding entry of a Type 0 font; however, they may
        appear in the deﬁnition of a ToUnicode CMap (see Section 5.9, “ToUnicode
        CMaps”).
      • begincidchar and endcidchar deﬁne mappings of individual input character
        codes to CIDs in the associated CIDFont. begincidrange and endcidrange do
        the same, but for ranges of input codes.
      • beginnotdefchar, endnotdefchar, beginnotdefrange, and endnotdefrange
        deﬁne notdef mappings from character codes to CIDs. As described in the
        section “Handling Undeﬁned Characters” on page 355, a notdef mapping is
        used if the normal mapping produces a CID for which no glyph is present in
        the associated CIDFont.
      The beginrearrangedfont, endrearrangedfont, beginusematrix, and enduse-
      matrix operators, described in Adobe Technical Note #5014, Adobe CMap and
      CIDFont Files Speciﬁcation, cannot be used in CMap ﬁles embedded in a PDF
      ﬁle.
5.6.5 Type 0 Font Dictionaries
      A Type 0 font dictionary contains the entries listed in Table 5.17.
      Example 5.12 shows a Type 0 font that refers to a single CIDFont. The CMap
      used is one of the predeﬁned CMaps listed in Table 5.14 on page 343, and is refer-
      enced by name.

                                                                                                    with existing Acrobat products.

CMap Mapping
When the current font is a Type 0 font, the text-showing operators (such as Tj)
interpret the bytes in the string to be shown according to the CMap speciﬁed as
the Encoding entry of the Type 0 font dictionary. The following paragraphs
describe how the characters in the string are decoded and mapped into character
selectors (which in PDF 1.3 must always be CIDs).
The number of bytes extracted from the string for each successive character is
determined exclusively by the codespace ranges in the CMap (delimited by
begincodespacerange and endcodespacerange). A codespace range is speciﬁed
by a pair of codes of some particular length giving the lower and upper bounds of
that range. A code is considered to match the range if it is the same length as the
bounding codes and the value of each of its bytes lies between the corresponding
bytes of the lower and upper bounds. The code length cannot exceed the number
of bytes representable in an integer (see Appendix C).
A sequence of one or more bytes is extracted from the string and matched against
the codespace ranges in the CMap. That is, the ﬁrst byte is matched against 1-byte
codespace ranges; if no match is found, a second byte is extracted, and the 2-byte
code is matched against 2-byte codespace ranges. This continues for successively
longer codes until a match is found or all codespace ranges have been tested.
There will be at most one match, since codespace ranges do not overlap.
The code extracted from the string is then looked up in the character code map-
pings for codes of that length. (These are the mappings deﬁned by beginbfchar,
endbfchar, begincidchar, endcidchar, and corresponding operators for ranges.)
Failing that, it is looked up in the notdef mappings, as described in the next
section.
The results of the CMap mapping algorithm are a font number and a character
selector. In PDF 1.3, the font number must always be 0 and the character selector
must always be a CID; this is the only case described here. The font number is
used as an index into the Type 0 font’s DescendantFonts array, selecting a
CIDFont. The CID is then used to select a glyph in the CIDFont. If the CIDFont
contains no glyph for that CID, the notdef mappings are consulted, as described
in the next section.
    Handling Undeﬁned Characters
    A CMap mapping operation can fail to select a glyph for any of a variety of rea-
    sons. This section describes what happens when that occurs.
    If a code maps to a CID for which there is no such glyph in the descendant
    CIDFont, the notdef mappings in the CMap are consulted to obtain a substitute
    character selector. These mappings (so called by analogy with the .notdef charac-
    ter mechanism in simple fonts) are delimited by the operators beginnotdefchar,
    endnotdefchar, beginnotdefrange, and endnotdefrange; they always map to a
    CID. If a matching notdef mapping is found, the CID selects a glyph in the asso-
    ciated descendant, which must be a CIDFont. If there is no glyph for that CID,
    the glyph for CID 0 (which is required to be present) is substituted.
    If the CMap does not contain either a character mapping or a notdef mapping for
    the code, descendant 0 is selected and the glyph for CID 0 is substituted from the
    associated CIDFont.
    If the code is invalid—that is, the bytes extracted from the string to be shown do
    not match any codespace range in the CMap—a substitute glyph is chosen as just
    described. The character mapping algorithm is reset to its original position in the
    string, and a modiﬁed mapping algorithm chooses the best partially matching
    codespace range, as follows:
    1. If the ﬁrst byte extracted from the string to be shown does not match the ﬁrst
        byte of any codespace range, the range having the shortest codes is chosen.
    2. Otherwise (that is, if there is a partial match), for each additional byte extract-
        ed, the code accumulated so far is matched against the beginnings of all longer
        codespace ranges until the longest such partial match has been found. If mul-
        tiple codespace ranges have partial matches of the same length, the one having
        the shortest codes is chosen.
    The length of the codes in the chosen codespace range determines the total num-
    ber of bytes to consume from the string for the current mapping operation.
5.7 Font Descriptors
    A font descriptor speciﬁes metrics and other attributes of a simple font or a
    CIDFont as a whole, as distinct from the metrics of individual glyphs. These font
            metrics provide information that enables a viewer application to synthesize a
            substitute font or select a similar font when the font program is unavailable. The
            font descriptor may also be used to embed the font program in the PDF ﬁle.
            (Font descriptors are not used with Type 0 or Type 3 fonts.)
            A font descriptor is a dictionary whose entries specify various font attributes. The
            entries common to all font descriptors—for both simple fonts and CIDFonts—
            are listed in Table 5.18; additional entries in the font descriptor for a CIDFont are
            described in Section 5.7.2, “Font Descriptors for CIDFonts.” All integer values are
            units in glyph space. The conversion from glyph space to text space is described
            in Section 5.1.3, “Glyph Positioning and Metrics.”

  5.7.1 Font Descriptor Flags
          The value of the Flags entry in a font descriptor is an unsigned 32-bit integer
          containing ﬂags specifying various characteristics of the font. Bit positions within
          the ﬂag word are numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (high-order). Table 5.19
          shows the meanings of the ﬂags; all undeﬁned ﬂag bits are reserved and must be
          set to 0. Figure 5.13 shows examples of fonts with these characteristics.
                                             TABLE 5.19 Font ﬂags
BIT POSITION      NAME            MEANING
      1           FixedPitch      All glyphs have the same width (as opposed to proportional or variable-pitch
                                  fonts, which have different widths).
      2           Serif           Glyphs have serifs, which are short strokes drawn at an angle on the top and
                                  bottom of glyph stems (as opposed to sans serif fonts, which do not).
      3           Symbolic        Font contains characters outside the Adobe standard Latin character set. This
                                  ﬂag and the Nonsymbolic ﬂag cannot both be set or both be clear (see below).
      4           Script          Glyphs resemble cursive handwriting.
      6           Nonsymbolic     Font uses the Adobe standard Latin character set or a subset of it (see below).
      7           Italic          Glyphs have dominant vertical strokes that are slanted.
     17           AllCap          Font contains no lowercase letters; typically used for display purposes such as
                                  titles or headlines.
     18           SmallCap        Font contains both uppercase and lowercase letters. The uppercase letters are
                                  similar to ones in the regular version of the same typeface family. The glyphs
                                  for the lowercase letters have the same shapes as the corresponding uppercase
                                  letters, but they are sized and their proportions adjusted so that they have the
                                  same size and stroke weight as lowercase glyphs in the same typeface family.
     19           ForceBold       See below.
           The Nonsymbolic ﬂag (bit 6 in the Flags entry) indicates that the font’s character
           set is the Adobe standard Latin character set (or a subset of it) and that it uses the
           standard names for those characters. The characters in this character set are
           shown in Section D.1, “Latin Character Set and Encodings.” If the font uses any
           characters outside this set, the Symbolic ﬂag should be set and the Nonsymbolic
           ﬂag clear; in other words, any font whose character set is not a subset of the
           Adobe standard character set is considered to be symbolic. This inﬂuences the
           font’s implicit base encoding and may affect a viewer application’s font substitu-
           tion strategies.

        FIGURE 5.13 Characteristics represented in the Flags entry of a font descriptor
Note: This classiﬁcation of nonsymbolic and symbolic fonts is peculiar to PDF. A
font may contain additional characters that are used in Latin writing systems but
are outside the Adobe standard Latin character set; PDF considers such a font to be
symbolic. The use of two ﬂags to represent a single binary choice is a historical acci-
dent.
The ForceBold ﬂag (bit 19) determines whether bold glyphs are painted with
extra pixels even at very small text sizes. Typically, when glyphs are painted at
small sizes on very low-resolution devices such as display screens, features of bold
glyphs may appear only 1 pixel wide. Because this is the minimum feature width
on a pixel-based device, ordinary (nonbold) glyphs also appear with 1-pixel-wide
features, and so cannot be distinguished from bold glyphs. If the ForceBold ﬂag is
set, features of bold glyphs may be thickened at small text sizes.
Example 5.13 illustrates a font descriptor whose Flags entry has the Serif,
Nonsymbolic, and ForceBold ﬂags (bits 2, 6, and 19) set.

5.7.2 Font Descriptors for CIDFonts
      In addition to the entries in Table 5.18 on page 356, the FontDescriptor diction-
      aries of CIDFonts may contain the entries listed in Table 5.20.
      Style
      The Style dictionary contains entries that deﬁne style attributes and values for
      the CIDFont. Currently, only the Panose entry is deﬁned. The value of Panose is
      a 12-byte string consisting of the following:
      • The font family class and subclass ID bytes, given in the sFamilyClass ﬁeld of the
        “OS/2” table in a TrueType font. This ﬁeld is documented in Microsoft’s True-
        Type 1.0 Font Files Technical Speciﬁcation.
      • Ten bytes for the PANOSE™ classiﬁcation number for the font. The PANOSE
        classiﬁcation system is documented in Hewlett-Packard Company’s PANOSE
        Classiﬁcation Metrics Guide.
      See the Bibliography for more information about these documents.

                                                                                                    “Font Subsets”).

                                                                                                    stored in bytes with the high-order bit ﬁrst. Each bit corresponds to a CID. The ﬁrst

       The following is an example of a Style entry in the font descriptor:
           /Style << /Panose <01 05 02 02 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00> >>
       FD
       A CIDFont may be made up of different classes of characters, each class requiring
       different sets of the fontwide attributes that appear in font descriptors. Latin
       characters, for example, may require different attributes than kanji characters.
       The font descriptor deﬁnes a set of default attributes that apply to all characters
       in the CIDFont; the FD entry in the font descriptor contains exceptions to these
       defaults.
         The key for each entry in an FD dictionary is the name of a class of characters—
         that is, a particular subset of the CIDFont’s character collection. The entry’s value
         is a font descriptor whose contents are to override the fontwide attributes for that
         class only. This font descriptor should contain entries for metric information
         only; it should not include FontFile, FontFile2, FontFile3, or any of the entries
         listed in Table 5.20.
         It is strongly recommended that the FD dictionary contain at least the metrics for
         the proportional Latin characters. With the information for these characters, a
         more accurate substitution font can be created.
         The names of the character classes depend on the character collection, as identi-
         ﬁed by the Registry, Ordering, and Supplement entries in the CIDSystemInfo
         dictionary. Table 5.21 lists the valid keys for the Adobe-GB1, Adobe-CNS1,
         Adobe-Japan1, Adobe-Japan2, and Adobe-Korea1 character collections.

5.8 Embedded Font Programs
    A font program can be embedded in a PDF ﬁle as data contained in a PDF stream
    object. Such a stream object is also called a font ﬁle, by analogy with font pro-
    grams that are available from sources external to the viewer application. (See also
    implementation note 50 in Appendix H.)
    Font programs are subject to copyright, and the copyright owner may impose
    conditions under which a font program can be used. These permissions are re-
          corded either in the font program itself or as part of a separate license. One of the
          conditions may be that the font program cannot be embedded, in which case it
          should not be incorporated into a PDF ﬁle. A font program may allow embed-
          ding for the sole purpose of viewing and printing the document, but not for cre-
          ating new or modiﬁed text using the font (in either the same document or other
          documents); the latter operation would require the user performing the opera-
          tion to have a licensed copy of the font program, not a copy extracted from the
          PDF ﬁle. In the absence of explicit information to the contrary, a PDF consumer
          should assume that any embedded font programs are to be used only to view and
          print the document and not for any other purposes.
          Table 5.22 summarizes the ways in which font programs are embedded in a PDF
          ﬁle, depending on the representation of the font program. The key is the name
          used in the font descriptor to refer to the font ﬁle stream; the subtype is the value
          of the Subtype key, if present, in the font ﬁle stream dictionary. Further details of
          speciﬁc font program representations are given below.

         Script syntax), an encrypted portion, and a ﬁxed-content portion. The ﬁxed-
         content portion contains 512 ASCII zeros followed by a cleartomark operator,
         and perhaps followed by additional data. While the encrypted portion of a stan-
         dard Type 1 font may be in binary or ASCII hexadecimal format, PDF supports
         only the binary format; however, the entire font program may be encoded using
         any ﬁlters.
         Example 5.15 shows the structure of an embedded standard Type 1 font.

As noted in Table 5.22, a Type 1–equivalent font program or a Type 0 CIDFont
program can be represented in the Compact Font Format (CFF). The Length1,
Length2, and Length3 entries are not needed in that case. Although CFF enables
multiple font or CIDFont programs to be bundled together in a single ﬁle, an
embedded CFF font ﬁle in PDF must consist of exactly one font or CIDFont (as
appropriate for the associated font dictionary).
Note: According to the Adobe Type 1 Font Format speciﬁcation, a Type 1 font pro-
gram may contain a PaintType entry specifying whether the glyphs’ outlines are to be
ﬁlled or stroked. For fonts embedded in a PDF ﬁle, this entry is ignored; the decision
whether to ﬁll or stroke glyph outlines is entirely determined by the PDF text render-
ing mode parameter (see Section 5.2.5, “Text Rendering Mode”). This also applies to
Type 1 compact fonts and Type 0 compact CIDFonts.
A TrueType font program may be used as part of either a font or a CIDFont.
Although the basic font ﬁle format is the same in both cases, there are different
requirements for what information must be present in the font program. The fol-
lowing TrueType tables are always required: “head,” “hhea,” “loca,” “maxp,”
“cvt_,” “prep,” “glyf,” “hmtx,” and “fpgm.” If used with a simple font dictionary,
the font program must additionally contain a “cmap” table deﬁning one or more
encodings, as discussed in “Encodings for TrueType Fonts” on page 332. If used
with a CIDFont dictionary, the “cmap” table is not needed, since the mapping
from character codes to glyph descriptions is provided separately.
    Note: The “vhea” and “vmtx” tables that specify vertical metrics are never used by a
    PDF viewer application. The only way to specify vertical metrics in PDF is by means
    of the DW2 and W2 entries in a CIDFont dictionary.
    As discussed in Section 5.5.3, “Font Subsets,” an embedded font program may
    contain only the subset of glyphs that are used in the PDF document. This may
    be indicated by the presence of a CharSet or CIDSet entry in the font descriptor
    that refers to the font ﬁle, although subset fonts are not always so identiﬁed.
5.9 ToUnicode CMaps
    The preceding sections describe all the facilities for showing text and causing the
    corresponding glyphs to be painted on the page. However, a viewer application
    sometimes needs to determine the information content of text—that is, its mean-
    ing according to some standard character identiﬁcation, as opposed to its ren-
    dered appearance. This need arises during operations such as searching,
    indexing, and exporting of text to other applications.
    The Unicode standard deﬁnes a system for numbering all of the common charac-
    ters used in a large number of languages. It is a suitable scheme for representing
    the information content of text, but not its appearance, since Unicode values
    identify characters, not glyphs. For information about Unicode, see the Unicode
    Standard by the Unicode Consortium (see the Bibliography).
    If a font’s characters are identiﬁed according to a standard character set that is
    known to the viewer application, the viewer can easily convert text to Unicode
    values with no additional information. This character identiﬁcation can occur if
    either the font uses a standard named encoding or the characters in the font are
    identiﬁed by standard character names or CIDs. A viewer application can identify
    characters if the font with which the text is shown is deﬁned in any of the follow-
    ing ways:
    • It uses one of the predeﬁned encodings         MacRomanEncoding, MacExpert-
       Encoding, WinAnsiEncoding, or any of the predeﬁned CMaps listed in Table
       5.14 on page 343 except Identity−H and Identity−V.
    • It is a Type 1 font whose character names are taken from the Adobe standard
       Latin character set and the set of named characters in the Symbol font, docu-
       mented in Appendix D.
• It is a Type 0 font whose descendant CIDFont uses the Adobe-GB1, Adobe-
   CNS1, Adobe-Japan1, or Adobe-Korea1 character collection (as speciﬁed in the
   CIDSystemInfo dictionary) whose supplement number is the one correspond-
   ing to the version of PDF supported by the viewer. See Table 5.15 on page 346
   for a list of the character collections corresponding to a given PDF version.
   (Other supplements of these character collections can be used, but if the sup-
   plement is higher-numbered than the one corresponding to the supported PDF
   version, only the CIDs in the latter supplement are considered to be standard
   CIDs.)
If a font is not deﬁned in one of these ways, the viewer application has no way to
identify characters in the text. The glyphs can still be shown, but the characters
cannot be converted to Unicode values without additional information. This in-
formation can be provided as an optional ToUnicode entry (PDF 1.2) in the font
dictionary, whose value is a stream object containing a special kind of CMap ﬁle
that maps character codes to Unicode values. This entry is discussed below; the
overall algorithm for mapping character codes to Unicode values is described in
more detail under “Unicode Mapping” on page 620.
The CMap deﬁned in the ToUnicode entry must follow the syntax for CMaps in-
troduced in Section 5.6.4, “CMaps” and fully documented in Adobe Technical
Note #5014, Adobe CMap and CIDFont Files Speciﬁcation. Additional guidance
regarding the CMap deﬁned in this entry is provided in Adobe Technical Note
#5411, ToUnicode Mapping File Tutorial. This CMap differs from an ordinary one
in the following ways:
• In the CMap stream dictionary, no CMap-speciﬁc entries are required. The
   only pertinent entry from the list in Table 5.16 on page 349 is UseCMap, which
   may be used if the CMap is based on another ToUnicode CMap.
• The CMap ﬁle must contain begincodespacerange and endcodespacerange
   operators that are consistent with the encoding that the font uses. In particular,
   for a simple font, the codespace must be one byte long.
• It must use the beginbfchar, endbfchar, beginbfrange, and endbfrange opera-
   tors to deﬁne the mapping from character codes to 2-byte Unicode values, in-
   terpreted high-order byte ﬁrst. These operators have been extended to handle
   cases where a single character code maps to one or more Unicode values, as
   described below.
Example 5.16 illustrates a Type 0 font that uses the Identity−H CMap to map from
character codes to CIDs, and whose descendant CIDFont uses the Identity map-
ping from CIDs to TrueType glyph indices. Text strings shown using this font
simply use a 2-byte glyph index for each character. In the absence of a ToUnicode
entry, there would be no information available about what the characters mean.

The value of the ToUnicode entry is a stream object that contains the deﬁnition of
the CMap, as shown in Example 5.17.

   endobj
The begincodespacerange and endcodespacerange operators in Example 5.17
deﬁne the source character code range to be the 2-byte character codes from
<00 00> to <FF FF>. The speciﬁc mappings for several of the character codes are
shown. For example, <00 00> to <00 5E> are mapped to the Unicode values
U+0020 to U+007E (where Unicode values are conventionally written as U+ fol-
lowed by four hexadecimal digits). This is followed by the deﬁnition of a map-
ping used where each character code represents more than one Unicode value:
   <005F> <0061> [<00660066> <00660069> <00660066006C>]
In this case, the original character codes are the glyph indices for the ligatures ff,
ﬁ, and fﬂ. The entry deﬁnes the mapping from the character codes <00 5F>,
<00 60>, and <00 61> to the string of Unicode values with a code for each char-
acter in the ligature: U+0066 U+0066 are the Unicode values for the character
sequence f f, U+0066 U+0069 for f i, and U+0066 U+0066 U+006c for f f l.
Example 5.17 illustrates several extensions to the way destination values can be
deﬁned. To support mappings from a source code to a string of destination codes,
the following extension has been made to the ranges deﬁned after a beginbfchar
operator:
   n beginbfchar
   srcCode dstString
   endbfchar
where dstString can be a string of up to 512 bytes. Likewise, mappings after the
beginbfrange operator may be deﬁned as:
   n beginbfrange
   srcCode1 srcCode2 dstString
   endbfrange
In this case, the last byte of the string will be incremented for each consecutive
code in the source code range. When deﬁning ranges of this type, care must be
taken to ensure that the value of the last byte in the string is less than or equal to
255 − (srcCode2 − srcCode1). This ensures that the last byte of the string will not
be incremented past 255; otherwise the result of mapping is undeﬁned and an
error occurs.
To support more compact representations of mappings from a range of source
character codes to a discontiguous range of destination codes, the CMaps used
for the ToUnicode entry may use the following syntax for the mappings following
a beginbfrange deﬁnition:
   n beginbfrange
   srcCode1 srcCoden [dstString1 dstString2 … dstStringn ]
   endbfrange
Consecutive codes starting with srcCode1 and ending with srcCoden are mapped to
the destination strings in the array starting with dstString1 and ending with
dstStringn .
                                    CHAPTER 6
                               6Rendering
THE ADOBE IMAGING MODEL separates graphics (the speciﬁcation of shapes
and colors) from rendering (controlling a raster output device). Figures 4.12 and
4.13 on pages 174 and 175 illustrate this division. Chapter 4 describes the facili-
ties for specifying the appearance of pages in a device-independent way. This
chapter describes the facilities for controlling how shapes and colors are rendered
on the raster output device. All of the facilities discussed here depend on the spe-
ciﬁc characteristics of the output device; PDF documents that are intended to be
device-independent should limit themselves to the general graphics facilities de-
scribed in Chapter 4.
Nearly all of the rendering facilities that are under the control of a PDF document
have to do with the reproduction of color. Colors are rendered by a multiple-step
process outlined below. (Depending on the current color space and on the char-
acteristics of the device, it is not always necessary to perform every step.)
1. If a color has been speciﬁed in a CIE-based color space (see Section 4.5.4,
   “CIE-Based Color Spaces”), it must ﬁrst be transformed to the native color
   space of the raster output device (also called its process color model).
2. If a color has been speciﬁed in a device color space that is inappropriate for the
   output device (for example, RGB color with a CMYK or grayscale device), a
   color conversion function is invoked.
3. The device color values are now mapped through transfer functions, one for
   each color component. The transfer functions compensate for peculiarities of
   the output device, such as nonlinear gray-level response. This step is some-
   times called gamma correction.
4. If the device cannot reproduce continuous tones, but only certain discrete
   colors such as black and white pixels, a halftone function is invoked, which
   approximates the desired colors by means of patterns of pixels.
                                           373
    5. Finally, scan conversion is performed to mark the appropriate pixels of the ras-
       ter output device with the requested colors.
    Once these operations have been performed for all graphics objects on the page,
    the resulting raster data is used to mark the physical output medium, such as
    pixels on a display or ink on a printed page. A PDF document speciﬁes very little
    about the properties of the physical medium on which the output will be pro-
    duced; that information is obtained from the following sources:
    • The media box and a few other entries in the page dictionary (see Section
      9.10.1, “Page Boundaries”).
    • An interactive dialog conducted when the user requests viewing or printing.
    • A job ticket, either embedded in the PDF ﬁle or provided separately, specifying
      detailed instructions for imposing PDF pages onto media and for controlling
      special features of the output device. Various standards exist for the format of
      job tickets; two of them, JDF (Job Deﬁnition Format) and PJTF (Portable Job
      Ticket Format), are described in the CIP4 document JDF Speciﬁcation and in
      Adobe Technical Note #5620, Portable Job Ticket Format (see the Bibliography).
    Some of the rendering facilities described in this chapter are controlled by device-
    dependent graphics state parameters, listed in Table 4.3 on page 150. These pa-
    rameters can be changed by invoking the gs operator with a parameter dictionary
    containing entries shown in Table 4.8 on page 157.
6.1 CIE-Based Color to Device Color
    To render CIE-based colors on an output device, the viewer application must
    convert from the speciﬁed CIE-based color space to the device’s native color
    space (typically DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, or DeviceCMYK), taking into account
    the known properties of the device. As discussed in Section 4.5.4, “CIE-Based
    Color Spaces,” CIE-based color is based on a model of human color perception.
    The goal of CIE-based color rendering is to produce output in the device’s native
    color space that accurately reproduces the requested CIE-based color values as
    perceived by a human observer. CIE-based color speciﬁcation and rendering are a
    feature of PDF 1.1 (CalGray, CalRGB, and Lab) and PDF 1.3 (ICCBased).
    The conversion from CIE-based color to device color is complex, and the theory
    on which it is based is beyond the scope of this book; see the Bibliography for
    sources of further information. The algorithm has many parameters, including
an optional, full three-dimensional color lookup table. The color ﬁdelity of the
output depends on having these parameters properly set, usually by a method
that includes some form of calibration. The colors that a device can produce are
characterized by a device proﬁle, which is usually speciﬁed by an ICC proﬁle asso-
ciated with the device (and entirely separate from the proﬁle that is speciﬁed in
an ICCBased color space).
Note: PDF has no equivalent of the PostScript color rendering dictionary. The means
by which a device proﬁle is associated with a viewer application’s output device are
implementation-dependent and cannot be speciﬁed in a PDF ﬁle. Typically, this is
done through a color management system (CMS) that is provided by the operating
system. Beginning with PDF 1.4, a PDF document can also specify one or more out-
put intents providing possible proﬁles that might be used to process the document
(see Section 9.10.4, “Output Intents”).
Conversion from a CIE-based color value to a device color value requires two
main operations:
1. Adjust the CIE-based color value according to a CIE-based gamut mapping
   function. A gamut is a subset of all possible colors in some color space. A page
   description has a source gamut consisting of all the colors it uses. An output
   device has a device gamut consisting of all the colors it can reproduce. This step
   transforms colors from the source gamut to the device gamut in a way that
   attempts to preserve color appearance, visual contrast, or some other explicitly
   speciﬁed rendering intent (see “Rendering Intents” on page 197).
2. Generate a corresponding device color value according to a CIE-based color
   mapping function. For a given CIE-based color value, this function computes a
   color value in the device’s native color space.
The CIE-based gamut and color mapping functions are applied only to color
values presented in a CIE-based color space. By deﬁnition, color values in device
color spaces directly control the device color components (though this can be al-
tered by the DefaultGray, DefaultRGB, and DefaultCMYK color space resources;
see “Default Color Spaces” on page 194).
The source gamut is speciﬁed by a page description when it selects a CIE-based
color space. This speciﬁcation is device-independent. The corresponding proper-
ties of the output device are given in the device proﬁle associated with the device.
The gamut mapping and color mapping functions are part of the implementa-
tion of the viewer application.
6.2 Conversions among Device Color Spaces
    Each raster output device has a native color space, which typically is one of the
    standard device color spaces (DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, or DeviceCMYK). In other
    words, most devices support reproduction of colors according to a grayscale
    (monochrome), RGB (red-green-blue), or CMYK (cyan-magenta-yellow-black)
    model. If the device supports continuous-tone output, reproduction occurs di-
    rectly. Otherwise, it is accomplished by means of halftoning.
    A device’s native color space is also called its process color model. Process colors
    are ones that are produced by combinations of one or more standard process
    colorants. Colors speciﬁed in any device or CIE-based color space are rendered as
    process colors. (A device can also support additional spot colorants, which can be
    painted only by means of Separation or DeviceN color spaces. They are not in-
    volved in the rendering of device or CIE-based color spaces, nor are they subject
    to the conversions described below.)
    Note: Some devices provide a native color space that is not one of the three named
    above but consists of a different combination of colorants. In that case, conversion
    from the standard device color spaces to the device’s native color space is performed
    by device-dependent means.
    Knowing the native color space and other output capabilities of the device, the
    viewer application can automatically convert the color values speciﬁed in a docu-
    ment to those appropriate for the device’s native color space. For example, if a
    document speciﬁes colors in the DeviceRGB color space but the device supports
    grayscale (such as a monochrome display) or CMYK (such as a color printer), the
    viewer application performs the necessary conversions. If the document speciﬁes
    colors directly in the device’s native color space, no conversions are necessary.
    The algorithms used to convert among device color spaces are very simple. As
    perceived by a human viewer, the conversions produce only crude approxima-
    tions of the original colors. More sophisticated control over color conversion can
    be achieved by means of CIE-based color speciﬁcation and rendering. Addition-
    ally, device color spaces can be remapped into CIE-based color spaces (see
    “Default Color Spaces” on page 194).
6.2.1 Conversion between DeviceGray and DeviceRGB
      Black, white, and intermediate shades of gray can be considered special cases of
      RGB color. A grayscale value is described by a single number: 0.0 corresponds to
      black, 1.0 to white, and intermediate values to different gray levels.
      A gray level is equivalent to an RGB value with all three components the same. In
      other words, the RGB color value equivalent to a speciﬁc gray value is simply
            red = gray
          green = gray
           blue = gray
      The gray value for a given RGB value is computed according to the NTSC video
      standard, which determines how a color television signal is rendered on a black-
      and-white television set:
          gray = 0.3 × red + 0.59 × green + 0.11 × blue
6.2.2 Conversion between DeviceGray and DeviceCMYK
      Nominally, a gray level is the complement of the black component of CMYK.
      Therefore, the CMYK color value equivalent to a speciﬁc gray level is simply
              cyan  =  0.0
          magenta   =  0.0
            yellow  =  0.0
             black  =  1.0 – gray
      To obtain the equivalent gray level for a given CMYK value, the contributions of
      all components must be taken into account:
          gray = 1.0 – min(1.0, 0.3 × cyan + 0.59 × magenta + 0.11 × yellow + black )
      The interactions between the black component and the other three are elaborated
      below.
6.2.3 Conversion from DeviceRGB to DeviceCMYK
      Conversion of a color value from RGB to CMYK is a two-step process. The ﬁrst
      step is to convert the red-green-blue value to equivalent cyan, magenta, and yel-
low components. The second step is to generate a black component and alter the
other components to produce a better approximation of the original color.
The subtractive color primaries cyan, magenta, and yellow are the complements
of the additive primaries red, green, and blue. For example, a cyan ink subtracts
the red component of white light. In theory, the conversion is very simple:
        cyan = 1.0 – red
   magenta = 1.0 – green
      yellow = 1.0 – blue
For example, a color that is 0.2 red, 0.7 green, and 0.4 blue can also be expressed
as 1.0 − 0.2 = 0.8 cyan, 1.0 − 0.7 = 0.3 magenta, and 1.0 − 0.4 = 0.6 yellow.
Logically, only cyan, magenta, and yellow are needed to generate a printing color.
An equal level of cyan, magenta, and yellow should create the equivalent level of
black. In practice, however, colored printing inks do not mix perfectly; such com-
binations often form dark brown shades instead of true black. To obtain a truer
color rendition on a printer, it is often desirable to substitute true black ink for
the mixed-black portion of a color. Most color printers support a black compo-
nent (the K component of CMYK). Computing the quantity of this component
requires some additional steps:
1. Black generation calculates the amount of black to be used when trying to re-
   produce a particular color.
2. Undercolor removal reduces the amounts of the cyan, magenta, and yellow
   components to compensate for the amount of black that was added by black
   generation.
The complete conversion from RGB to CMYK is as follows, where BG(k) and
UCR(k) are invocations of the black-generation and undercolor-removal func-
tions, respectively:
            c =  1.0 – red
           m  =  1.0 – green
           y  =  1.0 – blue
           k  =  min (c, m, y)
        cyan  =  min (1.0 , max ( 0.0 , c – UCR (k) ) )
   magenta    =  min (1.0 , max ( 0.0 , m – UCR (k) ) )
      yellow  =  min (1.0 , max ( 0.0 , y – UCR (k) ) )
       black  =  min (1.0 , max ( 0.0 , BG (k) ) )
In PDF 1.2, the black-generation and undercolor-removal functions are deﬁned
as PDF function dictionaries (see Section 3.9, “Functions”) that are parameters in
the graphics state. They are speciﬁed as the values of the BG and UCR (or BG2 and
UCR2) entries in a graphics state parameter dictionary (see Table 4.8 on page
157). Each function is called with a single numeric operand and is expected to
return a single numeric result.
The input of both the black-generation and undercolor-removal functions is k,
the minimum of the intermediate c, m, and y values that have been computed by
subtracting the original red, green, and blue components from 1.0. Nominally, k is
the amount of black that can be removed from the cyan, magenta, and yellow
components and substituted as a separate black component.
The black-generation function computes the black component as a function of
the nominal k value. It can simply return its k operand unchanged or it can re-
turn a larger value for extra black, a smaller value for less black, or 0.0 for no
black at all.
The undercolor-removal function computes the amount to subtract from each of
the intermediate c, m, and y values to produce the ﬁnal cyan, magenta, and yellow
components. It can simply return its k operand unchanged or it can return 0.0
(so no color is removed), some fraction of the black amount, or even a negative
amount, thereby adding to the total amount of colorant.
The ﬁnal component values that result after applying black generation and
undercolor removal are expected to be in the range 0.0 to 1.0. If a value falls out-
side this range, the nearest valid value is substituted automatically, without error
indication. This is indicated explicitly by the min and max operations in the for-
mulas above.
The correct choice of black-generation and undercolor-removal functions de-
pends on the characteristics of the output device—for example, how inks mix.
Each device is conﬁgured with default values that are appropriate for that device.
See Section 7.6.4, “Rendering Parameters and Transparency,” and in particular
“Rendering Intent and Color Conversions” on page 468, for further discussion of
the role of black-generation and undercolor-removal functions in the transparent
imaging model.
6.2.4 Conversion from DeviceCMYK to DeviceRGB
      Conversion of a color value from CMYK to RGB is a simple operation that does
      not involve black generation or undercolor removal:
            red = 1.0 – min (1.0, cyan + black)
          green = 1.0 – min (1.0, magenta + black)
           blue = 1.0 – min (1.0, yellow + black)
      In other words, the black component is simply added to each of the other compo-
      nents, which are then converted to their complementary colors by subtracting
      them each from 1.0.
 6.3 Transfer Functions
      In PDF 1.2, a transfer function adjusts the values of color components to compen-
      sate for nonlinear response in an output device and in the human eye. Each com-
      ponent of a device color space—for example, the red component of the
      DeviceRGB space—is intended to represent the perceived lightness or intensity of
      that color component in proportion to the component’s numeric value. Many
      devices do not actually behave this way, however; the purpose of a transfer func-
      tion is to compensate for the device’s actual behavior. This operation is some-
      times called gamma correction (not to be confused with the CIE-based gamut
      mapping function performed as part of CIE-based color rendering).
      In the sequence of steps for processing colors, the viewer application applies the
      transfer function after performing any needed conversions between color spaces,
      but before applying a halftone function, if necessary. Each color component has
      its own separate transfer function; there is no interaction between components.
      Transfer functions always operate in the native color space of the output device,
      regardless of the color space in which colors were originally speciﬁed. (For exam-
      ple, for a CMYK device, the transfer functions apply to the device’s cyan, magen-
      ta, yellow, and black color components, even if the colors were originally
      speciﬁed in, say, a DeviceRGB or CalRGB color space.) The transfer function is
      called with a numeric operand in the range 0.0 to 1.0 and must return a number
      in the same range. The input is the value of a color component in the device’s
      native color space, either speciﬁed directly or produced by conversion from some
      other color space. The output is the transformed component value to be trans-
      mitted to the device (after halftoning, if necessary).
Both the input and the output of a transfer function are always interpreted as if
the corresponding color component were additive (red, green, blue, or gray): the
greater the numeric value, the lighter the color. If the component is subtractive
(cyan, magenta, yellow, black, or a spot color), it is converted to additive form by
subtracting it from 1.0 before it is passed to the transfer function. The output of
the function is always in additive form, and is passed on to the halftone function
in that form.
In PDF 1.2, transfer functions are deﬁned as PDF function objects (see Section
3.9, “Functions”). There are two ways to specify transfer functions:
• The current transfer function parameter in the graphics state consists of either a
  single transfer function or an array of four separate transfer functions, one
  each for red, green, blue, and gray or their complements cyan, magenta, yellow,
  and black. (If only a single function is speciﬁed, it applies to all components.)
  An RGB device uses the ﬁrst three; a monochrome device uses the gray transfer
  function only; and a CMYK device uses all four. The current transfer function
  can be speciﬁed as the value of the TR or TR2 entry in a graphics state parameter
  dictionary; see Table 4.8 on page 157.
• The current halftone parameter in the graphics state can specify transfer func-
  tions as optional entries in halftone dictionaries (see Section 6.4.4, “Halftone
  Dictionaries”). This is the only way to set transfer functions for nonprimary
  color components, or for any component in devices whose native color space
  uses components other than the ones listed above. A transfer function speciﬁed
  in a halftone dictionary overrides the corresponding one speciﬁed by the cur-
  rent transfer function parameter in the graphics state.
In addition to their intended use for gamma correction, transfer functions can be
used to produce a variety of special, device-dependent effects. For example, on a
monochrome device, the PostScript calculator function
   {1 exch sub}
inverts the output colors, producing a negative rendition of the page. In general,
this method does not work for color devices; inversion can be more complicated
than merely inverting each of the components. Because transfer functions pro-
duce device-dependent effects, a page description that is intended to be device-
independent should not alter them.
    Note: When the current color space is DeviceGray and the output device’s native
    color space is DeviceCMYK, the interpreter uses only the gray transfer function. The
    normal conversion from DeviceGray to DeviceCMYK produces 0.0 for the cyan,
    magenta, and yellow components. These components are not passed through their
    respective transfer functions but are rendered directly, producing output containing
    no colored inks. This special case exists for compatibility with existing applications
    that use a transfer function to obtain special effects on monochrome devices, and
    applies only to colors speciﬁed in the DeviceGray color space.
    See Section 7.6.4, “Rendering Parameters and Transparency,” and in particular
    “Halftone and Transfer Function” on page 467, for further discussion of the role
    of transfer functions in the transparent imaging model.
6.4 Halftones
    Halftoning is a process by which continuous-tone colors are approximated on an
    output device that can achieve only a limited number of discrete colors. Colors
    that the device cannot produce directly are simulated by using patterns of pixels
    in the colors available. Perhaps the most familiar example is the rendering of gray
    tones with black and white pixels, as in a newspaper photograph.
    Some output devices can reproduce continuous-tone colors directly. Halftoning
    is not required for such devices; after gamma correction by the transfer func-
    tions, the color components are transmitted directly to the device. On devices
    that do require halftoning, it occurs after all color components have been trans-
    formed by the applicable transfer functions. The input to the halftone function
    consists of continuous-tone, gamma-corrected color components in the device’s
    native color space. Its output consists of pixels in colors the device can reproduce.
    PDF provides a high degree of control over details of the halftoning process. For
    example, in color printing, independent halftone screens can be speciﬁed for
    each of several colorants. When rendering on low-resolution displays, ﬁne con-
    trol over halftone patterns is needed to achieve the best approximations of gray
    levels or colors and to minimize visual artifacts.
    Note: Remember that everything pertaining to halftones is, by deﬁnition, device-
    dependent. In general, when a PDF document provides its own halftone speciﬁca-
    tions, it sacriﬁces portability. Associated with every output device is a default half-
    tone deﬁnition that is appropriate for most purposes. Only relatively sophisticated
    documents need to deﬁne their own halftones to achieve special effects.
      All halftones are deﬁned in device space, unaffected by the current transforma-
      tion matrix. For correct results, a PDF document that deﬁnes a new halftone
      must make assumptions about the resolution and orientation of device space.
      The best choice of halftone parameters often depends on speciﬁc physical proper-
      ties of the output device, such as pixel shape, overlap between pixels, and the
      effects of electronic or mechanical noise.
6.4.1 Halftone Screens
      In general, halftoning methods are based on the notion of a halftone screen, which
      divides the array of device pixels into cells that can be modiﬁed to produce the
      desired halftone effects. A screen is deﬁned by conceptually laying a uniform rec-
      tangular grid over the device pixel array. Each pixel belongs to one cell of the grid;
      a single cell typically contains many pixels. The screen grid is deﬁned entirely in
      device space, and is unaffected by modiﬁcations to the current transformation
      matrix. This property is essential to ensure that adjacent areas colored by half-
      tones are properly stitched together without visible “seams.”
      On a bilevel (black-and-white) device, each cell of a screen can be made to ap-
      proximate a shade of gray by painting some of the cell’s pixels black and some
      white. Numerically, the gray level produced within a cell is the ratio of white pix-
      els to the total number of pixels in the cell. A cell containing n pixels can render
      n + 1 different gray levels, ranging from all pixels black to all pixels white. A de-
      sired gray value g in the range 0.0 to 1.0 is produced by making i pixels white,
      where i = ﬂoor(g × n).
      The foregoing description also applies to color output devices whose pixels con-
      sist of primary colors that are either completely on or completely off. Most color
      printers, but not color displays, work this way. Halftoning is applied to each color
      component independently, producing shades of that color.
      Color components are presented to the halftoning machinery in additive form,
      regardless of whether they were originally speciﬁed additively (RGB or gray) or
      subtractively (CMYK or tint). Larger values of a color component represent light-
      er colors—greater intensity in an additive device such as a display, or less ink in a
      subtractive device such as a printer. Transfer functions produce color values in
      additive form; see Section 6.3, “Transfer Functions.”
6.4.2 Spot Functions
      A common way of deﬁning a halftone screen is by specifying a frequency, angle,
      and spot function. The frequency is the number of halftone cells per inch; the
      angle indicates the orientation of the grid lines relative to the device coordinate
      system. As a cell’s desired gray level varies from black to white, individual pixels
      within the cell change from black to white in a well-deﬁned sequence: if a partic-
      ular gray level includes certain white pixels, lighter grays will include the same
      white pixels along with some additional ones. The order in which pixels change
      from black to white for increasing gray levels is determined by a spot function,
      which speciﬁes that order in an indirect way that minimizes interactions with the
      screen frequency and angle.
      Consider a halftone cell to have its own coordinate system: the center of the cell is
      the origin and the corners are at coordinates ±1.0 horizontally and vertically.
      Each pixel in the cell is centered at horizontal and vertical coordinates that both
      lie in the range −1.0 to +1.0. For each pixel, the spot function is invoked with the
      pixel’s coordinates as input and must return a single number in the range −1.0 to
      +1.0, deﬁning the pixel’s position in the whitening order.
      The speciﬁc values the spot function returns are not signiﬁcant; all that matters
      are the relative values returned for different pixels. As a cell’s gray level varies
      from black to white, the ﬁrst pixel whitened is the one for which the spot func-
      tion returns the lowest value, the next pixel is the one with the next higher spot
      function value, and so on. If two pixels have the same spot function value, their
      relative order is chosen arbitrarily.
      PDF provides built-in deﬁnitions for many of the most commonly used spot
      functions. A halftone can simply specify any of these predeﬁned spot functions by
      name instead of giving an explicit function deﬁnition. For example, the name
      SimpleDot designates a spot function whose value is inversely related to a pixel’s
      distance from the center of the halftone cell. This produces a “dot screen” in
      which the black pixels are clustered within a circle whose area is inversely pro-
      portional to the gray level. The predeﬁned function Line is a spot function whose
      value is the distance from a given pixel to a line through the center of the cell,
      producing a “line screen” in which the white pixels grow away from that line.
          Table 6.1 shows the predeﬁned spot functions. The table gives the mathematical
          deﬁnition of each function along with the corresponding PostScript language
          code as it would be deﬁned in a PostScript calculator function (see Section 3.9.4,
          “Type 4 (PostScript Calculator) Functions”). The image accompanying each
          function shows how the relative values of the function are distributed over the
          halftone cell, indicating the approximate order in which pixels are whitened; pix-
          els corresponding to darker points in the image are whitened later than those cor-
          responding to lighter points. (See implementation note 51 in Appendix H.)

  6.4.3 Threshold Arrays
        Another way to deﬁne a halftone screen is with a threshold array that directly
        controls individual device pixels in a halftone cell. This technique provides a high
degree of control over halftone rendering. It also permits halftone cells to be arbi-
trary rectangles, whereas those controlled by a spot function are always square.
A threshold array is much like a sampled image—a rectangular array of pixel
values—but is deﬁned entirely in device space. Depending on the halftone type,
the threshold values occupy 8 or 16 bits each. Threshold values nominally repre-
sent gray levels in the usual way, from 0 for black up to the maximum (255 or
65,535) for white. The threshold array is replicated to tile the entire device space:
each pixel in device space is mapped to a particular sample in the threshold array.
On a bilevel device, where each pixel is either black or white, halftoning with a
threshold array proceeds as follows:
1. For each device pixel that is to be painted with some gray level, consult the
   corresponding threshold value from the threshold array.
2. If the requested gray level is less than the threshold value, paint the device pix-
   el black; otherwise, paint it white. Gray levels in the range 0.0 to 1.0 corre-
   spond to threshold values from 0 to the maximum available (255 or 65,535).
Note: A threshold value of 0 is treated as if it were 1; therefore, a gray level of 0.0
paints all pixels black, regardless of the values in the threshold array.
This scheme easily generalizes to monochrome devices with multiple bits per
pixel. For example, if there are 2 bits per pixel, each pixel can directly represent
one of four different gray levels: black, dark gray, light gray, or white, encoded as
0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For any device pixel that is speciﬁed with some in-
between gray level, the halftoning algorithm consults the corresponding value in
the threshold array to determine whether to use the next-lower or next-higher
representable gray level. In this situation, the threshold values do not represent
absolute gray levels, but rather gradations between any two adjacent represent-
able gray levels.
A halftone deﬁned in this way can also be used with color displays that have a
limited number of values for each color component. The red, green, and blue
components are simply treated independently as gray levels, applying the ap-
propriate threshold array to each. (This technique also works for a screen deﬁned
as a spot function, since the spot function is used to compute a threshold array
internally.)
6.4.4 Halftone Dictionaries
      In PDF 1.2, the graphics state includes a current halftone parameter, which deter-
      mines the halftoning process to be used by the painting operators. The current
      halftone can be speciﬁed as the value of the HT entry in a graphics state parameter
      dictionary; see Table 4.8 on page 157. It may be deﬁned by either a dictionary or a
      stream, depending on the type of halftone; the term halftone dictionary is used
      generically throughout this section to refer to either a dictionary object or the
      dictionary portion of a stream object. (Those halftones that are deﬁned by
      streams are speciﬁcally identiﬁed as such in the descriptions of particular half-
      tone types; unless otherwise stated, they are understood to be deﬁned by simple
      dictionaries instead.)
      Every halftone dictionary must have a HalftoneType entry whose value is an inte-
      ger specifying the overall type of halftone deﬁnition. The remaining entries in the
      dictionary are interpreted according to this type. PDF supports the halftone types
      listed in Table 6.2.

      TYPE       MEANING
        1        Deﬁnes a single halftone screen by a frequency, angle, and spot function.
        5        Deﬁnes an arbitrary number of halftone screens, one for each colorant or color
                 component (including both primary and spot colorants). The keys in this
                 dictionary are names of colorants; the values are halftone dictionaries of other
                 types, each deﬁning the halftone screen for a single colorant.
        6        Deﬁnes a single halftone screen by a threshold array containing 8-bit sample
                 values.
      10         Deﬁnes a single halftone screen by a threshold array containing 8-bit sample
                 values, representing a halftone cell that may have a nonzero screen angle.
      16         (PDF 1.3) Deﬁnes a single halftone screen by a threshold array containing 16-
                 bit sample values, representing a halftone cell that may have a nonzero screen
                 angle.
The dictionaries representing these halftone types contain the same entries as
the corresponding PostScript language halftone dictionaries (as described in Sec-
tion 7.4 of the PostScript Language Reference, Third Edition), with the following
exceptions:
• The PDF dictionaries may contain a Type entry with the value Halftone, identi-
   fying the type of PDF object that the dictionary describes.
• Spot functions and transfer functions are represented by function objects in-
   stead of PostScript procedures.
• Threshold arrays are speciﬁed as streams instead of ﬁles.
• In type 5 halftone dictionaries, the keys for colorants must be name objects;
   they may not be strings as they may in PostScript.
Halftone dictionaries have an optional entry, HalftoneName, that identiﬁes the
desired halftone by name. In PDF 1.3, if this entry is present, all other entries,
including HalftoneType, are optional. At rendering time, if the output device has
a halftone with the speciﬁed name, that halftone will be used, overriding any
other halftone parameters speciﬁed in the dictionary. This provides a way for
PDF documents to select the proprietary halftones supplied by some device man-
ufacturers, which would not otherwise be accessible because they are not explicit-
ly deﬁned in PDF. If there is no HalftoneName entry, or if the requested halftone
name does not exist on the device, the halftone’s parameters are deﬁned by the
other entries in the dictionary, if any. If no other entries are present, the default
halftone is used.
See Section 7.6.4, “Rendering Parameters and Transparency,” and in particular
“Halftone and Transfer Function” on page 467, for further discussion of the role
of halftones in the transparent imaging model.

          If the optional entry AccurateScreens is present with a boolean value of true, a
          highly precise halftoning algorithm is substituted in place of the standard one; if
          the AccurateScreens entry is false or is not present, ordinary halftoning is used.
          Accurate halftoning achieves the requested screen frequency and angle with very
          high accuracy, whereas ordinary halftoning adjusts them so that a single screen
          cell is quantized to device pixels. High accuracy is important mainly for making
          color separations on high-resolution devices. However, it may be computational-
          ly expensive and so is ordinarily disabled.
In principle, PDF permits the use of halftone screens with arbitrarily large cells—
in other words, arbitrarily low frequencies. However, cells that are very large
relative to the device resolution or that are oriented at unfavorable angles may ex-
ceed the capacity of available memory. If this happens, an error will occur. The
AccurateScreens feature often requires very large amounts of memory to achieve
the highest accuracy.

Type 6 Halftones
A type 6 halftone deﬁnes a halftone screen with a threshold array. The halftone is
represented as a stream containing the threshold values; the parameters deﬁning
the halftone are speciﬁed by entries in the stream dictionary. Table 6.4 shows the
contents of this dictionary, in addition to the usual entries common to all streams
(see Table 3.4 on page 38). The Width and Height entries specify the dimensions
of the threshold array in device pixels; the stream must contain Width × Height
bytes, each representing a single threshold value. Threshold values are deﬁned in
device space in the same order as image samples in image space (see Figure 4.26
on page 265), with the ﬁrst value at device coordinates (0, 0) and horizontal co-
ordinates changing faster than vertical.
Type 10 Halftones
Although type 6 halftones can be used to specify a threshold array with a zero
screen angle, they make no provision for other angles. The type 10 halftone re-
moves this restriction and allows the use of threshold arrays for halftones with
nonzero screen angles as well.

          Halftone cells at nonzero angles can be difﬁcult to specify, because they may not
          line up well with scan lines and because it may be difﬁcult to determine where a
          given sampled point goes. The type 10 halftone addresses these difﬁculties by
          dividing the halftone cell into a pair of squares that line up at zero angles with the
          output device’s pixel grid. The squares contain the same information as the origi-
          nal cell, but are much easier to store and manipulate. In addition, they can be
          mapped easily into the internal representation used for all rendering.
          Figure 6.2 shows a halftone cell with a frequency of 38.4 cells per inch and an
          angle of 50.2 degrees, represented graphically in device space at a resolution of
          300 dots per inch. Each asterisk in the ﬁgure represents a location in device space
          that is mapped to a speciﬁc location in the threshold array.

Figure 6.3 shows how the halftone cell can be divided into two squares. If the
squares and the original cell are tiled across device space, the area to the right of
the upper square maps exactly into the empty area of the lower square, and vice
versa (see Figure 6.4). The last row in the ﬁrst square is immediately adjacent to
the ﬁrst row in the second and starts in the same column.

Any halftone cell can be divided in this way. The side of the upper square (X) is
equal to the horizontal displacement from a point in one halftone cell to the cor-
responding point in the adjacent cell, such as those marked by asterisks in Figure
6.4. The side of the lower square (Y) is the vertical displacement between the
same two points. The frequency of a halftone screen constructed from squares
with sides X and Y is thus given by
                resolution

          Like a type 6 halftone, a type 10 halftone is represented as a stream containing
          the threshold values, with the parameters deﬁning the halftone speciﬁed by en-
          tries in the stream dictionary. Table 6.5 shows the contents of this dictionary, in
          addition to the usual entries common to all streams (see Table 3.4 on page 38);
          the Xsquare and Ysquare entries replace the type 6 halftone’s Width and Height
          entries.

          The Xsquare and Ysquare entries specify the dimensions of the two squares in
          device pixels; the stream must contain Xsquare 2 + Ysquare 2 bytes, each repre-
          senting a single threshold value. The contents of square X are speciﬁed ﬁrst,
          followed by those of square Y. Threshold values within each square are deﬁned in
          device space in the same order as image samples in image space (see Figure 4.26
          on page 265), with the ﬁrst value at device coordinates (0, 0) and horizontal co-
          ordinates changing faster than vertical.
Type 16 Halftones
Like type 10, a type 16 halftone (PDF 1.3) deﬁnes a halftone screen with a thresh-
old array and allows nonzero screen angles. In type 16, however, each element of
the threshold array is 16 bits wide instead of 8. This allows the threshold array to
distinguish 65,536 levels of color rather than only 256 levels. The threshold array
can consist of either one or two rectangles. If two rectangles are speciﬁed, they
will tile the device space as shown in Figure 6.5. The last row in the ﬁrst rectangle
is immediately adjacent to the ﬁrst row in the second and starts in the same
column.

A type 16 halftone, like type 6 and type 10, is represented as a stream containing
the threshold values, with the parameters deﬁning the halftone speciﬁed by en-
tries in the stream dictionary. Table 6.6 shows the contents of this dictionary, in
addition to the usual entries common to all streams (see Table 3.4 on page 38).
The dictionary’s Width and Height entries deﬁne the dimensions of the ﬁrst (or
only) rectangle; those of the second, optional rectangle are deﬁned by the option-
al entries Width2 and Height2. Each threshold value is represented as 2 bytes,
with the high-order byte ﬁrst. The stream must thus contain 2 × Width × Height
bytes if there is only one rectangle, or 2 × (Width × Height + Width2 × Height2)
bytes if there are two. The contents of the ﬁrst rectangle are speciﬁed ﬁrst, fol-
lowed by those of the second rectangle. Threshold values within each rectangle
are deﬁned in device space in the same order as image samples in image space
(see Figure 4.26 on page 265), with the ﬁrst value at device coordinates (0, 0) and
horizontal coordinates changing faster than vertical.

          Type 5 Halftones
          Some devices, particularly color printers, require separate halftones for each indi-
          vidual colorant. Also, devices that can produce named separations may require
          individual halftones for each separation. Halftone dictionaries of type 5 allow
          individual halftones to be speciﬁed for an arbitrary number of colorants or color
          components.
           A type 5 halftone dictionary (Table 6.7) is a composite dictionary containing
           independent halftone deﬁnitions for multiple colorants. Its keys are name objects
           representing the names of individual colorants or color components. The values
           associated with these keys are other halftone dictionaries, each deﬁning the half-
           tone screen and transfer function for a single colorant or color component. The
           component halftone dictionaries may be of any supported type except 5.

                                        or stream                                                   does not have an entry of its own. The value may not be a type 5 halftone. If
                                                                                                    there are any nonprimary colorants, the default halftone must have a transfer
                                                                                                    function.
           The colorants or color components represented in a type 5 halftone dictionary
           fall into two categories:
           • Primary color components for the standard native device color spaces (Red,
             Green, and Blue for DeviceRGB; Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black for Device-
             CMYK; Gray for DeviceGray).
           • Nonstandard color components for use as spot colorants in Separation and
             DeviceN color spaces. Some of these may also be used as process colorants if the
             native color space is nonstandard.
           The dictionary must also contain an entry whose key is Default; the value of this
           entry is a halftone dictionary to be used for any color component that does not
           have an entry of its own.
When a halftone dictionary of some other type appears as the value of an entry in
a type 5 halftone dictionary, it applies only to the single colorant or color com-
ponent named by that entry’s key. This is in contrast to such a dictionary’s being
used as the current halftone parameter in the graphics state, which applies to all
color components. If nonprimary colorants are requested when the current half-
tone is deﬁned by any means other than a type 5 halftone dictionary, the gray
halftone screen and transfer function are used for all such colorants.
Example 6.2 shows a type 5 halftone dictionary with the primary color compo-
nents for a CMYK device. In this example, the halftone dictionaries for the color
components and for the default all use the same spot function.

6.5 Scan Conversion Details
    The ﬁnal step of rendering is scan conversion. As discussed in Section 2.1.4, “Scan
    Conversion,” the viewer application executes a scan conversion algorithm to
    paint graphics, text, and images in the raster memory of the output device.
    The speciﬁcs of the scan conversion algorithm are not deﬁned as part of PDF.
    Different implementations can perform scan conversion in different ways; tech-
    niques that are appropriate for one device may be inappropriate for another. Still,
    it is useful to have a general understanding of how scan conversion works, partic-
    ularly when creating PDF documents intended for viewing on a display. At the
    low resolutions typical of displays, variations of even one pixel’s width can have a
    noticeable effect on the appearance of painted shapes.
      The following sections describe the scan conversion algorithms that are typical of
      Adobe Acrobat products. (These details also apply to Adobe PostScript products,
      yielding consistent results when a viewer application prints a document on a
      PostScript printer.) Most scan conversion details are not under program control,
      but a few are; the parameters for controlling them are described here.
6.5.1 Flatness Tolerance
      The ﬂatness tolerance controls the maximum permitted distance in device pixels
      between the mathematically correct path and an approximation constructed
      from straight line segments, as shown in Figure 6.6. Flatness can be speciﬁed as
      the operand of the i operator (see Table 4.7 on page 156) or as the value of the FL
      entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary (see Table 4.8 on page 157). It must
      be a positive number; smaller values yield greater precision at the cost of more
      computation.
      Note: Although the ﬁgure exaggerates the difference between the curved and ﬂat-
      tened paths for the sake of clarity, the purpose of the ﬂatness tolerance is to control
      the precision of curve rendering, not to draw inscribed polygons. If the parameter’s
      value is large enough to cause visible straight line segments to appear, the result is
      unpredictable.
                                          Flatness error
                                            tolerance
                                   FIGURE 6.6 Flatness tolerance
6.5.2 Smoothness Tolerance
      The smoothness tolerance (PDF 1.3) controls the quality of smooth shading
      (type 2 patterns and the sh operator), and thus indirectly controls the rendering
      performance. Smoothness is the allowable color error between a shading approx-
      imated by piecewise linear interpolation and the true value of a (possibly non-
      linear) shading function. The error is measured for each color component, and
      the maximum error is used. The allowable error (or tolerance) is expressed as a
      fraction of the range of the color component, from 0.0 to 1.0. Thus, a smoothness
      tolerance of 0.1 represents a tolerance of 10 percent in each color component.
      Smoothness can be speciﬁed as the value of the SM entry in a graphics state
      parameter dictionary (see Table 4.8 on page 157).
      Each output device may have internal limits on the maximum and minimum
      tolerances attainable. For example, setting smoothness to 1.0 may result in an in-
      ternal smoothness of 0.5 on a high-quality color device, while setting it to 0.0 on
      the same device may result in an internal smoothness of 0.01 if an error of that
      magnitude is imperceptible on the device.
      The smoothness tolerance may also interact with the accuracy of color conver-
      sion. In the case of a color conversion deﬁned by a sampled function, the con-
      version function is unknown. Thus the error may be sampled at too low a
      frequency, in which case the accuracy deﬁned by the smoothness tolerance can-
      not be guaranteed. In most cases, however, where the conversion function is
      smooth and continuous, the accuracy should be within the speciﬁed tolerance.
      The effect of the smoothness tolerance is similar to that of the ﬂatness tolerance.
      Note, however, that ﬂatness is measured in device-dependent units of pixel
      width, whereas smoothness is measured as a fraction of color component range.
6.5.3 Scan Conversion Rules
      The following rules determine which device pixels a painting operation will af-
      fect. All references to coordinates and pixels are in device space. A shape is a path
      to be painted with the current color or with an image. Its coordinates are mapped
      into device space, but not rounded to device pixel boundaries. At this level,
      curves have been ﬂattened to sequences of straight lines, and all “insideness”
      computations have been performed.
Pixel boundaries always fall on integer coordinates in device space. A pixel is a
square region identiﬁed by the location of its corner with minimum horizontal
and vertical coordinates. The region is half-open, meaning that it includes its
lower but not its upper boundaries. More precisely, for any point whose real-
number coordinates are (x, y), let i = ﬂoor(x) and j = ﬂoor(y). The pixel that
contains this point is the one identiﬁed as (i, j). The region belonging to that pix-
el is deﬁned to be the set of points (x′, y′) such that i ≤ x′ < i + 1 and j ≤ y′ < j + 1.
Like pixels, shapes to be painted by ﬁlling and stroking operations are also treated
as half-open regions that include the boundaries along their “ﬂoor” sides, but not
along their “ceiling” sides.
A shape is scan-converted by painting any pixel whose square region intersects
the shape, no matter how small the intersection is. This ensures that no shape
ever disappears as a result of unfavorable placement relative to the device pixel
grid, as might happen with other possible scan conversion rules. The area covered
by painted pixels is always at least as large as the area of the original shape. This
rule applies both to ﬁll operations and to strokes with nonzero width. Zero-width
strokes are done in a device-dependent manner that may include fewer pixels
than the rule implies.
Note: Normally, the intersection of two regions is deﬁned as the intersection of their
interiors. However, for purposes of scan conversion, a ﬁlling region is considered to
intersect every pixel through which its boundary passes, even if the interior of the ﬁll-
ing region is empty. Thus, for example, a zero-width or zero-height rectangle will
paint a line 1 pixel wide.
The region of device space to be painted by a sampled image is determined simi-
larly to that of a ﬁlled shape, though not identically. The viewer application trans-
forms the image’s source rectangle into device space and deﬁnes a half-open
region, just as for ﬁll operations. However, only those pixels whose centers lie
within the region are painted. The position of the center of such a pixel—in other
words, the point whose coordinate values have fractional parts of one-half—is
mapped back into source space to determine how to color the pixel. There is no
averaging over the pixel area; if the resolution of the source image is higher than
that of device space, some source samples will not be used.
For clipping, the clipping region consists of the set of pixels that would be in-
cluded by a ﬁll operation. Subsequent painting operations affect a region that is
the intersection of the set of pixels deﬁned by the clipping region with the set of
pixels for the region to be painted.
      Scan conversion of character glyphs is performed by a different algorithm from
      the one above. That font rendering algorithm uses hints in the glyph descriptions
      and techniques that are specialized to glyph rasterization.
6.5.4 Automatic Stroke Adjustment
      When a stroke is drawn along a path, the scan conversion algorithm may produce
      lines of nonuniform thickness because of rasterization effects. In general, the line
      width and the coordinates of the endpoints, transformed into device space, are
      arbitrary real numbers not quantized to device pixels. A line of a given width can
      intersect with different numbers of device pixels, depending on where it is posi-
      tioned. Figure 6.7 illustrates this effect.
      For best results, it is important to compensate for the rasterization effects to pro-
      duce strokes of uniform thickness. This is especially important in low-resolution
      display applications. To meet this need, PDF 1.2 provides an optional automatic
      stroke adjustment feature. When stroke adjustment is enabled, the line width and
      the coordinates of a stroke are automatically adjusted as necessary to produce
      lines of uniform thickness. The thickness is as near as possible to the requested
      line width—no more than half a pixel different.

                          FIGURE 6.7 Rasterization without stroke adjustment
Note: If stroke adjustment is enabled and the requested line width, transformed into
device space, is less than half a pixel, the stroke is rendered as a single-pixel line. This
is the thinnest line that can be rendered at device resolution. It is equivalent to the
effect produced by setting the line width to 0 (see Section 6.5.3, “Scan Conversion
Rules”).
Because automatic stroke adjustment can have a substantial effect on the appear-
ance of lines, a PDF document must be able to control whether the adjustment is
to be performed. This can be speciﬁed with the stroke adjustment parameter in
the graphics state, set via the SA entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary
(see Section 4.3.4, “Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries”).

                        7Transparency
PDF 1.4 EXTENDS the Adobe imaging model to include the notion of transpar-
ency. Transparent objects do not necessarily obey a strict opaque painting model,
but can blend (composite) in interesting ways with other overlapping objects. This
chapter describes the general transparency model, but does not attempt to cover
how it is to be implemented. Although implementation-like descriptions are used
at various points to describe how things work, this is only for the purpose of
elucidating the behavior of the model; the actual implementation will almost cer-
tainly be different from what these descriptions might imply.
The chapter is organized as follows:
• Section 7.1, “Overview of Transparency,” introduces the basic concepts of the
  transparency model and its associated terminology.
• Section 7.2, “Basic Compositing Computations,” describes the mathematics
  involved in compositing a single object with its backdrop.
• Section 7.3, “Transparency Groups,” introduces the concept of transparency
  groups and describes their properties and behavior.
• Section 7.4, “Soft Masks,” covers the creation and use of masks to specify
  position-dependent shape and opacity.
• Section 7.5, “Specifying Transparency in PDF,” describes how transparency
  properties are represented in a PDF document.
• Section 7.6, “Color Space and Rendering Issues,” deals with some speciﬁc inter-
  actions between transparency and other aspects of color speciﬁcation and
  rendering.

7.1 Overview of Transparency
    The original Adobe imaging model paints objects (ﬁlls, strokes, text, and images),
    possibly clipped by a path, opaquely onto a page. The color of the page at any
    point is that of the topmost enclosing object, disregarding any previous objects it
    may overlap. This effect can be—and often is—realized simply by rendering ob-
    jects directly to the page in the order in which they are speciﬁed, with each object
    completely overwriting any others that it overlaps.
    Under the transparent imaging model, all of the objects on a page can potentially
    contribute to the result. Objects at a given point can be thought of as forming a
    transparency stack (or just stack for short), arranged from bottom to top in the
    order in which they are speciﬁed. The color of the page at each point is deter-
    mined by combining the colors of all enclosing objects in the stack according to
    compositing rules deﬁned by the transparency model.
    Note: The order in which objects are speciﬁed determines the stacking order, but not
    necessarily the order in which the objects are actually painted onto the page. In
    particular, the transparency model does not require a viewer application to rasterize
    objects immediately or to commit to a raster representation at any time before ren-
    dering the entire stack onto the page. This is important, since rasterization often
    causes signiﬁcant loss of information and precision that is best avoided during inter-
    mediate stages of the transparency computation.
    A given object is composited with a backdrop. Ordinarily, the backdrop consists
    of the stack of all objects that have been speciﬁed previously; the result of com-
    positing is then treated as the backdrop for the next object. However, within cer-
    tain kinds of transparency group (see below), a different backdrop is chosen.
    When an object is composited with its backdrop, the color at each point is com-
    puted using a speciﬁed blend mode, which is a function of both the object’s color
    and the backdrop color. The blend mode determines how colors interact; differ-
    ent blend modes can be used to achieve a variety of useful effects. A single blend
    mode is in effect for compositing all of a given object, but different blend modes
    can be applied to different objects.
    Compositing of an object with its backdrop is mediated by two scalar quantities
    called shape and opacity. Conceptually, for each object, these quantities are de-
    ﬁned at every point in the plane, just as if they were additional color components.
(In actual practice, they are often obtained from auxiliary sources rather than be-
ing intrinsic to the object itself.)
Both shape and opacity vary from 0.0 (no contribution) to 1.0 (maximum con-
tribution). At any point where either the shape or the opacity of an object is 0.0,
its color is undeﬁned. At points where the shape is 0.0, the opacity is also unde-
ﬁned. The shape and opacity are themselves subject to compositing rules, so that
the stack as a whole also has a shape and opacity at each point.
An object’s opacity, in combination with the backdrop’s opacity, determines the
relative contributions of the backdrop color, the object’s color, and the blended
color to the resulting composite color. The object’s shape then determines the de-
gree to which the composite color replaces the backdrop color. Shape values of
0.0 and 1.0 identify points that lie “outside” and “inside” a conventional sharp-
edged object; intermediate values are useful in deﬁning soft-edged objects.
Shape and opacity are conceptually very similar. In fact, they can usually be com-
bined into a single value, called alpha, which controls both the color compositing
computation and the fading between an object and its backdrop. However, there
are a few situations in which they must be treated separately; see Section 7.3.5,
“Knockout Groups.” Moreover, raster-based implementations must maintain a
separate shape parameter in order to do anti-aliasing properly; it is therefore con-
venient to have it be an explicit part of the model.
One or more consecutive objects in a stack can be collected together into a trans-
parency group (often referred to hereafter simply as a group). The group as a
whole can have various properties that modify the compositing behavior of ob-
jects within the group and their interactions with its backdrop. An additional
blend mode, shape, and opacity can also be associated with the group as a whole
and used when compositing it with its backdrop. Groups can be nested within
other groups, forming a tree-structured hierarchy.
Note: The concept of a transparency group is independent of existing notions of
“group” or “layer” in applications such as Adobe Illustrator®. Those groupings reﬂect
logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects,
but they are not part of the imaging model.
Plate 16 illustrates the effects of transparency grouping. In the upper two ﬁgures,
three colored circles are painted as independent objects, with no grouping. At the
upper left, the three objects are painted opaquely (opacity = 1.0); each object
    completely replaces its backdrop (including previously painted objects) with its
    own color. At the upper right, the same three independent objects are painted
    with an opacity of 0.5, causing them to composite with each other and with the
    gray and white backdrop. In the lower two ﬁgures, the three objects are combined
    as a transparency group. At the lower left, the individual objects have an opacity
    of 1.0 within the group, but the group as a whole is painted in the Normal blend
    mode with an opacity of 0.5. The objects thus completely overwrite each other
    within the group, but the resulting group then composites transparently with the
    gray and white backdrop. At the lower right, the objects have an opacity of 0.5
    within the group and thus composite with each other; the group as a whole is
    painted against the backdrop with an opacity of 1.0, but in a different blend
    mode (HardLight), producing a different visual effect.
    The color result of compositing a group can be converted to a single-component
    luminosity value and treated as a soft mask. Such a mask can then be used as an
    additional source of shape or opacity values for subsequent compositing opera-
    tions. When the mask is used as a shape, this technique is known as soft clipping;
    it is a generalization of the current clipping path in the opaque imaging model
    (see Section 4.4.3, “Clipping Path Operators”).
    The notion of current page is generalized to refer to a transparency group consist-
    ing of the entire stack of objects placed on the page, composited with a backdrop
    that is pure white and fully opaque. Logically, this entire stack is then rasterized
    to determine the actual pixel values to be transmitted to the output device.
    Note: In contexts where a PDF page is treated as a piece of artwork to be placed on
    some other page—such as an Illustrator artboard or an Encapsulated PostScript
    (EPS) ﬁle—it is treated not as a page but as a group, whose backdrop may be deﬁned
    differently from that of a page.
7.2 Basic Compositing Computations
    This section describes the basic computations for compositing a single object
    with its backdrop. These computations will be extended in Section 7.3, “Trans-
    parency Groups,” to cover groups consisting of multiple objects.
7.2.1 Basic Notation for Compositing Computations
      In general, variable names in this chapter consisting of a lowercase letter denote a
      scalar quantity, such as an opacity; uppercase letters denote a value with multiple
      scalar components, such as a color. In the descriptions of the basic color compos-
      iting computations, color values are generally denoted by the letter C, with a
      mnemonic subscript indicating which of several color values is being referred to;
      for instance, Cs stands for “source color.” Shape and opacity values are denoted
      respectively by the letters f (for “form factor”) and q (for “opaqueness”)—again
      with a mnemonic subscript, such as qs for “source opacity.” The symbol α (alpha)
      stands for a product of shape and opacity values.
      In certain computations, one or more variables may have undeﬁned values; for
      instance, when opacity is zero, the corresponding color is undeﬁned. A quantity
      can also be undeﬁned if it results from division by zero. In any formula that uses
      such an undeﬁned quantity, the quantity has no effect on the ultimate result,
      because it is subsequently multiplied by zero or otherwise canceled out. The sig-
      niﬁcant point is that while any arbitrary value can be chosen for such an unde-
      ﬁned quantity, the computation must not malfunction because of exceptions
      caused by overﬂow or division by zero. It is convenient to adopt the further con-
      vention that 0 ÷ 0 = 0.
7.2.2 Basic Compositing Formula
      The primary change in the imaging model to accommodate transparency is in
      how colors are painted. In the transparent model, the result of painting (the result
      color) is a function of both the color being painted (the source color) and the color
      it is painted over (the backdrop color). Both of these colors may vary as a function
      of position on the page, but for the purposes of this section we will focus our at-
      tention on some ﬁxed point on the page and assume a ﬁxed backdrop and source
      color.
      Other parameters in this computation are the alpha, which controls the relative
      contributions of the backdrop and source colors, and the blend function, which
      speciﬁes how they are combined in the painting operation. The resulting basic
      color compositing formula (or just basic compositing formula for short) determines
      the result color produced by the painting operation:
                   αs                αs
          C r = 1 – -----  × C b + ----- × [ ( 1 – α b ) × C s + α b × B ( C b , C s ) ]
                   αr                αr
      where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 7.1.
                    TABLE 7.1 Variables used in the basic compositing formula
      VARIABLE                MEANING
      Cb                      Backdrop color
      Cs                      Source color
      Cr                      Result color
      αb                      Backdrop alpha
      αs                      Source alpha
      αr                      Result alpha
      B ( Cb , Cs )           Blend function
      This is actually a simpliﬁed form of the compositing formula in which the shape
      and opacity values are combined and represented as a single alpha value; the
      more general form is presented later. This function is based on the over operation
      deﬁned in the article “Compositing Digital Images,” by Porter and Duff (see the
      Bibliography), extended to include a blend mode in the region of overlapping
      coverage. The following sections elaborate on the meaning and implications of
      this formula.
7.2.3 Blending Color Space
      Note that the compositing formula shown above is actually a vector function: the
      colors it operates on are represented in the form of n-element vectors, where n is
      the number of components required by the color space in which compositing is
      performed. The ith component of the result color Cr is obtained by applying the
      compositing formula to the ith components of the constituent colors Cb , Cs , and
      B(Cb , Cs ). The result of the computation thus depends on the color space in
which the colors are represented. For this reason, the color space used for com-
positing, called the blending color space, is explicitly made part of the transparent
imaging model. When necessary, backdrop and source colors are converted to the
blending color space prior to the compositing computation.
Of the PDF color spaces described in Section 4.5, “Color Spaces,” the following
are supported as blending color spaces:
• DeviceGray
• DeviceRGB
• DeviceCMYK
• CalGray
• CalRGB
• ICCBased color spaces equivalent to those above (including calibrated CMYK)
The Lab space and ICCBased spaces that represent lightness and chromaticity
separately (such as L*a*b*, L*u*v*, and HSV) are not allowed as blending color
spaces, because the compositing computations in such spaces do not give
meaningful results when applied separately to each component. In addition, an
ICCBased space used as a blending color space must be bidirectional; that is, the
ICC proﬁle must contain both AToB and BToA transformations.
The blending color space is consulted only for process colors. Although blending
can also be done on individual spot colors speciﬁed in a Separation or DeviceN
color space, such colors are never converted to a blending color space (except in
the case where they ﬁrst revert to their alternate color space, as described under
“Separation Color Spaces” on page 201 and “DeviceN Color Spaces” on page
205). Instead, the speciﬁed color components are blended individually with the
corresponding components of the backdrop.
The blend functions for the various blend modes assume that the range for each
color component is 0.0 to 1.0 and that the color space is additive. The former
condition is true for all of the allowed blending color spaces, but the latter is not.
In particular, the DeviceCMYK, Separation, and DeviceN spaces are subtractive.
When performing blending operations in subtractive color spaces, it is assumed
that the color component values are complemented (subtracted from 1.0) before
the blend function is applied and that the results of the function are then com-
plemented back before being used. This adjustment makes the effects of the vari-
      ous blend modes numerically consistent across all color spaces. However, the
      actual visual effect produced by a given blend mode still depends on the color
      space. Blending in a device color space produces device-dependent results,
      whereas in a CIE-based space it produces results that are consistent across all de-
      vices. See Section 7.6, “Color Space and Rendering Issues,” for additional details
      concerning color spaces.
7.2.4 Blend Mode
      In principle, the blend function B(Cb , Cs ), used in the compositing formula to
      customize the blending operation, could be any function of the backdrop and
      source colors that yields another color, Cr , for the result. PDF deﬁnes a standard
      set of named blend functions, or blend modes, listed in Tables 7.2 and 7.3. Plates
      18 and 19 illustrate the resulting visual effects for RGB and CMYK colors, respec-
      tively.
      A blend mode is termed separable if each component of the result color is com-
      pletely determined by the corresponding components of the constituent back-
      drop and source colors—that is, if the blend mode function B is applied
      separately to each set of corresponding components:
         cr = B ( cb , cs )
      where the lowercase variables cr , cb , and cs denote corresponding components of
      the colors Cr , Cb , and Cs , expressed in additive form. (Theoretically, a blend
      mode could have a different function for each color component and still be sepa-
      rable; however, none of the standard PDF blend modes have this property.) A
      separable blend mode can be used with any color space, since it applies indepen-
      dently to any number of components. Only separable blend modes can be used
      for blending spot colors.
      Table 7.2 lists the standard separable blend modes available in PDF. Some of
      them are deﬁned by actual mathematical formulas; the rest are characterized only
      by a general description of their intended effects.
         TABLE 7.2 Standard separable blend modes
NAME     RESULT
Normal   Selects the source color, ignoring the backdrop:
             B ( cb , cs ) = cs
Multiply Multiplies the backdrop and source color values:
             B ( cb , cs ) = cb × cs
         The result color is always at least as dark as either of the two con-
         stituent colors. Multiplying any color with black produces black;
         multiplying with white leaves the original color unchanged. Paint-
         ing successive overlapping objects with a color other than black or
         white produces progressively darker colors.
Screen   Multiplies the complements of the backdrop and source color
         values, then complements the result:
             B ( cb , cs ) = 1 – [ ( 1 – cb ) × ( 1 – cs ) ]
                             = cb + cs – ( cb × cs )
         The result color is always at least as light as either of the two constit-
         uent colors. Screening any color with white produces white; screen-
         ing with black leaves the original color unchanged. The effect is
         similar to projecting multiple photographic slides simultaneously
         onto a single screen.
Overlay  Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the backdrop color.
         Source colors overlay the backdrop while preserving its highlights
         and shadows. The backdrop color is not replaced, but is mixed with
         the source color to reﬂect the lightness or darkness of the backdrop.
Darken   Selects the darker of the backdrop and source colors:
             B ( c b , c s ) = min ( c b , c s )
         The backdrop is replaced with the source where the source is dark-
         er; otherwise it is left unchanged.
Lighten  Selects the lighter of the backdrop and source colors:
             B ( c b , c s ) = max ( c b , c s )
         The backdrop is replaced with the source where the source is light-
         er; otherwise it is left unchanged.
ColorDodge          Brightens the backdrop color to reﬂect the source color. Painting
                    with black produces no change.
ColorBurn           Darkens the backdrop color to reﬂect the source color. Painting
                    with white produces no change.
HardLight           Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the source color
                    value. If the source color is lighter than 0.5, the backdrop is light-
                    ened, as if it were screened; this is useful for adding highlights to a
                    scene. If the source color is darker than 0.5, the backdrop is dark-
                    ened, as if it were multiplied; this is useful for adding shadows to a
                    scene. The degree of lightening or darkening is proportional to the
                    difference between the source color and 0.5; if it is equal to 0.5, the
                    backdrop is unchanged. Painting with pure black or white produces
                    pure black or white. The effect is similar to shining a harsh spotlight
                    on the backdrop.
SoftLight           Darkens or lightens the colors, depending on the source color
                    value. If the source color is lighter than 0.5, the backdrop is light-
                    ened, as if it were dodged; this is useful for adding highlights to a
                    scene. If the source color is darker than 0.5, the backdrop is dark-
                    ened, as if it were burned in. The degree of lightening or darkening
                    is proportional to the difference between the source color and 0.5; if
                    it is equal to 0.5, the backdrop is unchanged. Painting with pure
                    black or white produces a distinctly darker or lighter area, but does
                    not result in pure black or white. The effect is similar to shining a
                    diffused spotlight on the backdrop.
Difference          Subtracts the darker of the two constituent colors from the lighter:
                        B ( cb , cs ) = cb – cs
                    Painting with white inverts the backdrop color; painting with black
                    produces no change.
Exclusion           Produces an effect similar to that of the Difference mode, but lower
                    in contrast. Painting with white inverts the backdrop color; paint-
                    ing with black produces no change.
Table 7.3 lists the standard nonseparable blend modes. Their effects are
described, but no mathematical formulas are given. These modes all entail con-
version to and from an intermediate HSL (hue-saturation-luminance) represen-
tation. Since the nonseparable blend modes consider all color components in
      combination, their computation depends on the blending color space in which
      the components are interpreted.
                             TABLE 7.3 Standard nonseparable blend modes
      NAME                     RESULT
      Hue                      Creates a color with the hue of the source color and the saturation
                               and luminance of the backdrop color.
      Saturation               Creates a color with the saturation of the source color and the hue
                               and luminance of the backdrop color. Painting with this mode in an
                               area of the backdrop that is a pure gray (no saturation) produces no
                               change.
      Color                    Creates a color with the hue and saturation of the source color and
                               the luminance of the backdrop color. This preserves the gray levels
                               of the backdrop and is useful for coloring monochrome images or
                               tinting color images.
      Luminosity               Creates a color with the luminance of the source color and the hue
                               and saturation of the backdrop color. This produces an inverse
                               effect to that of the Color mode.
      Note: An additional standard blend mode, Compatible, is a vestige of an earlier de-
      sign and is no longer needed, but is still recognized for the sake of compatibility; its
      effect is equivalent to that of the Normal blend mode. See “Compatibility with
      Opaque Overprinting” on page 460 for further discussion.
7.2.5 Interpretation of Alpha
      The color compositing formula
                    αs                αs
          C r = 1 – -----  × C b + ----- × [ ( 1 – α b ) × C s + α b × B ( C b , C s ) ]
                    αr                αr
      produces a result color that is a weighted average of the backdrop color, the
      source color, and the blended B(Cb , Cs ) term, with the weighting determined by
      the backdrop and source alphas αb and αs . For the simplest blend mode, Normal,
      deﬁned by
          B ( cb , cs ) = cs
      the compositing formula collapses to a simple weighted average of the backdrop
      and source colors, controlled by the backdrop and source alpha values. For more
      interesting blend functions, the backdrop and source alphas control whether the
      effect of the blend mode is fully realized or is toned down by mixing the result
      with the backdrop and source colors.
      The result alpha, αr , is actually a computed result, described below in Section
      7.2.6, “Shape and Opacity Computations.” The result color is normalized by the
      result alpha, ensuring that when this color and alpha are subsequently used to-
      gether in another compositing operation, the color’s contribution will be correct-
      ly represented. Note that if αr is zero, the result color is undeﬁned.
      The formula shown above is a simpliﬁcation of the following one, which presents
      the relative contributions of backdrop, source, and blended colors in a more
      straightforward way:
          αr × Cr = [ ( 1 – αs ) × αb × Cb ] + [ ( 1 – αb ) × αs × Cs ] + [ αb × αs × B ( Cb , Cs ) ]
      (The simpliﬁcation requires a substitution based on the alpha compositing for-
      mula, which is presented in the next section.) Thus, mathematically, the back-
      drop and source alphas control the inﬂuence of the backdrop and source colors,
      respectively, while their product controls the inﬂuence of the blend function. An
      alpha value of αs = 0.0 or αb = 0.0 results in no blend mode effect; setting αs = 1.0
      and αb = 1.0 results in maximum blend mode effect.
7.2.6 Shape and Opacity Computations
      As stated earlier, the alpha values that control the compositing process are de-
      ﬁned as the product of shape and opacity:
          αb = fb × qb
          αr = fr × qr
          αs = fs × qs
      This section examines the various shape and opacity values individually. Once
      again, keep in mind that conceptually these values are computed for every point
      on the page.
Source Shape and Opacity
Shape and opacity values can come from several sources. The transparency mod-
el provides for three independent sources for each; however, the PDF representa-
tion imposes some limitations on the ability to specify all of these sources
independently (see Section 7.5.3, “Specifying Shape and Opacity”).
• Object shape. Elementary objects such as strokes, ﬁlls, and text have an intrin-
   sic shape, whose value is 1.0 for points inside the object and 0.0 outside. Simi-
   larly, an image with an explicit mask (see “Explicit Masking” on page 277) has
   a shape that is 1.0 in the unmasked portions and 0.0 in the masked portions.
   The shape of a group object is the union of the shapes of the objects it con-
   tains.
   Note: Mathematically, elementary objects have “hard” edges, with a shape value
   of either 0.0 or 1.0 at every point. However, when such objects are rasterized to
   device pixels, the shape values along the boundaries may be anti-aliased, taking on
   fractional values representing fractional coverage of those pixels. When such anti-
   aliasing is performed, it is important to treat the fractional coverage as shape rath-
   er than opacity.
• Mask shape. Shape values for compositing an object can be taken from an addi-
   tional source, or soft mask, independent of the object itself. (See Section 7.4,
   “Soft Masks,” for a discussion of how such a mask might be generated.) The use
   of a soft mask to modify the shape of an object or group, called soft clipping,
   can produce effects such as a gradual transition between an object and its back-
   drop, as in a vignette.
• Constant shape. The source shape can be modiﬁed at every point by a scalar
   shape constant. This is merely a convenience, since the same effect could be
   achieved with a shape mask whose value is the same everywhere.
• Object opacity. Elementary objects have an opacity of 1.0 everywhere. The
   opacity of a group object is the result of the opacity computations for all of the
   objects it contains.
• Mask opacity. Opacity values, like shape values, can be provided by a soft mask
   independent of the object being composited.
• Constant opacity. The source opacity can be modiﬁed at every point by a scalar
  opacity constant. It is useful to think of this value as the “current opacity,” anal-
  ogous to the current color used when painting elementary objects.
All of these shape and opacity inputs range in value from 0.0 to 1.0, with a default
value of 1.0. The intent is that any of the inputs will make the painting operation
more transparent as it goes toward 0.0. If more than one input goes toward 0.0,
the effect is compounded. This is achieved mathematically by simply multiplying
the three inputs of each type, producing intermediate values called the source
shape and the source opacity:
    fs = fj × fm × fk
   qs = qj × qm × qk
where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 7.4.
          TABLE 7.4 Variables used in the source shape and opacity formulas
VARIABLE              MEANING
   fs                 Source shape
   fj                 Object shape
   fm                 Mask shape
   fk                 Constant shape
   qs                 Source opacity
   qj                 Object opacity
   qm                 Mask opacity
   qk                 Constant opacity
Note: When an object is painted with a tiling pattern, the object shape and object
opacity for points in the object’s interior are determined by those of corresponding
points in the pattern, rather than being 1.0 everywhere (see Section 7.5.6, “Patterns
and Transparency”).
Result Shape and Opacity
In addition to a result color, the painting operation also computes an associat-
ed result shape and result opacity. These computations are based on the union
function
   Union ( b, s ) = 1 – [ ( 1 – b ) × ( 1 – s ) ]
                           = b + s – (b × s)
where b and s are the backdrop and source values to be composited. This is a gen-
eralization of the conventional concept of union for opaque shapes, and can be
thought of as an “inverted multiplication”—a multiplication with the inputs and
outputs complemented. The result tends toward 1.0: if either input is 1.0, the re-
sult will be 1.0.
The result shape and opacity are given by
    f r = Union ( f b , f s )
          Union ( f b × q b , f s × q s )
   q r = -------------------------------------------------------
                                                               -
                                   fr
where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 7.5.
           TABLE 7.5 Variables used in the result shape and opacity formulas
VARIABLE                            MEANING

   qs                               Source opacity
      These formulas can be interpreted as follows:
      • The result shape is simply the union of the backdrop and source shapes.
      • The result opacity is the union of the backdrop and source opacities, weighted
        by their respective shapes. The result is then normalized by the result shape,
        ensuring that when this shape and opacity are subsequently used together in
        another compositing operation, the opacity’s contribution will be correctly
        represented.
      Since alpha is just the product of shape and opacity, it can easily be shown that
         α r = Union ( α b , α s )
      This formula can be used whenever the independent shape and opacity results
      are not needed.
7.2.7 Summary of Basic Compositing Computations
      Below is a summary of all the computations presented in this section. They are
      given in an order such that no variable is used before it is computed; also, some of
      the formulas have been rearranged to simplify them. See Tables 7.1, 7.4, and 7.5
      above for the meanings of the variables used in these formulas.
         Union ( b, s ) = 1 – [ ( 1 – b ) × ( 1 – s ) ]

7.3 Transparency Groups
    A transparency group is a sequence of consecutive objects in a transparency stack
    that are collected together and composited to produce a single color, shape, and
    opacity at each point. The result is then treated as if it were a single object for
    subsequent compositing operations. This facilitates creating independent pieces
    of artwork, each composed of multiple objects, and then combining them, possi-
    bly with additional transparency effects applied during the combination. Groups
    can be nested within other groups to form a tree-structured group hierarchy.
    The objects contained within a group are treated as a separate transparency stack,
    called the group stack. The objects in the stack are composited against some initial
    backdrop (discussed later), producing a composite color, shape, and opacity for
    the group as a whole. The result is an object whose shape is the union of the
    shapes of its constituent objects and whose color and opacity are the result of the
    compositing operations. This object is then composited with the group’s back-
    drop in the usual way.
    In addition to its computed color, shape, and opacity, the group as a whole can
    have several further attributes:
    • All of the input variables that affect the compositing computation for individu-
      al objects can also be applied when compositing the group with its backdrop.
      These include mask and constant shape, mask and constant opacity, and blend
      mode.
    • The group can be isolated or non-isolated, determining the initial backdrop
      against which its stack is composited.
    • The group can be knockout or non-knockout, determining whether the objects
      within its stack are composited with one another or only with the group’s back-
      drop.
    • An isolated group can specify its own blending color space, independent of that
      of the group’s backdrop.
    • Instead of being composited onto the current page, a group’s results can be
      used as a source of shape or opacity values for creating a soft mask (see Section
      7.4, “Soft Masks”).
      The next section introduces some new notation for dealing with group com-
      positing. Subsequent sections describe the group compositing formulas for a
      non-isolated, non-knockout group and the special properties of isolated and
      knockout groups.
7.3.1 Notation for Group Compositing Computations
      Since we are now dealing with multiple objects at a time, it is useful to have some
      notation for distinguishing among them. Accordingly, the variables introduced
      earlier are altered to include a second-level subscript denoting an object’s posi-
      tion in the transparency stack. Thus, for example, C s stands for “source color of
                                                                           i
      the ith object in the stack.” The subscript 0 represents the initial backdrop; sub-
      scripts 1 to n denote the bottommost to topmost objects in an n-element stack. In
      addition, the subscripts b and r are dropped from the variables Cb , fb , qb , αb , Cr ,
      fr , qr , and αr ; other variables retain their mnemonic subscripts.
      These conventions permit the compositing formulas to be restated as recurrence
      relations among the elements of a stack. For instance, the result of the color com-
      positing computation for object i is denoted by Ci (formerly Cr ). This computa-
      tion takes as one of its inputs the immediate backdrop color, which is the result of
      the color compositing computation for object i − 1; this is denoted by Ci − 1
      (formerly Cb ).
      The revised formulas for a simple n-element stack (not including any groups)
      are, for i = 1, …, n:
            fs = fj × fm × fk
               i      i      i     i
           qs = qj × qm × qk
               i       i       i     i
           αs = fs × qs
               i       i    i
            α i = Union ( α i – 1 , α s )
                                           i
             f i = Union ( f i – 1 , f s )

7.3.2 Group Structure and Nomenclature
      As stated earlier, the elements of a group are treated as a separate transparency
      stack, the group stack. These objects are composited against a selected initial
      backdrop (to be described) and the resulting color, shape, and opacity are then
      treated as if they belonged to a single object. The resulting object is in turn com-
      posited with the group’s backdrop in the usual way.
      This computation entails interpreting the stack as a tree. For an n-element group
      that begins at position i in the stack, it treats the next n objects as an n-element
      substack, whose elements are given an independent numbering of 1 to n. These
      objects are then removed from the object numbering in the parent (containing)
      stack and replaced by the group object, numbered i, followed by the remaining
      objects to be painted on top of the group, renumbered starting at i + 1. This oper-
      ation applies recursively to any nested subgroups. Henceforth, the term element
      (denoted Ei ) refers to a member of some group; it can itself be either an individ-
      ual object or a contained subgroup.
      From the perspective of a particular element in a nested group, there are three
      different backdrops of interest:
      • The group backdrop is the result of compositing all elements up to but not in-
        cluding the ﬁrst element in the group. (This deﬁnition is altered if the parent
        group is a knockout group; see Section 7.3.5, “Knockout Groups.”)
      • The initial backdrop is a backdrop that is selected for compositing the group’s
        ﬁrst element. This is either the same as the group backdrop (for a non-isolated
        group) or a fully transparent backdrop (for an isolated group).
      • The immediate backdrop is the result of compositing all elements in the group
        up to but not including the current element.
      When all elements in a group have been composited, the result is treated as if the
      group were a single object, which is then composited with the group backdrop.
      (Note that this operation occurs whether the initial backdrop chosen for com-
      positing the elements of the group was the group backdrop or a transparent
      backdrop. There is a special correction to ensure that the backdrop’s contribution
      to the overall result is applied only once.)
7.3.3 Group Compositing Computations
      The color and opacity of a group are deﬁned by the group compositing function:
          〈 C, f, α 〉 = Composite (C 0, α 0, G )
      where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 7.7.
         TABLE 7.7 Arguments and results of the group compositing function

                      ments E1, …, En of the group—the n constituent objects’ colors,
                      shapes, opacities, and blend modes

                      the group itself is treated as an object
    f                 Computed shape of the group, to be used as the object shape when
                      the group itself is treated as an object
    α0                Alpha of the group’s backdrop
    α                 Computed alpha of the group, to be used as the object alpha when
                      the group itself is treated as an object
Note that the opacity is not given explicitly as an argument or result of this func-
tion. Almost all of the computations use the product of shape and opacity (alpha)
rather than opacity by itself, so it is usually convenient to work directly with
shape and alpha, rather than shape and opacity. When needed, the opacity can be
computed by dividing the alpha by the associated shape.
The result of applying the group compositing function is then treated as if it were
a single object, which in turn is composited with the group’s backdrop according
to the usual formulas. In those formulas, the color, shape, and alpha (C, f, and α)
calculated by the group compositing function are used, respectively, as the source
color Cs , the object shape fj , and the object alpha αj .
The group compositing formulas for a non-isolated, non-knockout group are de-
ﬁned as follows:
• Initialization:
   f g = α g = 0.0
       0           0

For an element Ei that is an elementary object, the color, shape, and alpha
values C s , f j , and α j are intrinsic attributes of the object itself. For an element
              i        i          i
that is itself a group, the group compositing function is applied recursively to the
subgroup and the resulting C, f, and α values are used for its C s , f j , and α j in

Note that the elements of a group are composited onto a backdrop that includes
the group’s initial backdrop. This is done to achieve the correct effects of the
blend modes, most of which are dependent on both the backdrop and source
colors being blended. (This feature is what distinguishes non-isolated groups
from isolated groups, discussed in the next section.)
Special attention should be directed to the formulas at the end that compute the
ﬁnal results, C, f, and α, of the group compositing function. Essentially, these for-
mulas remove the contribution of the group backdrop from the computed re-
sults. This ensures that when the group itself is subsequently composited with
that backdrop (possibly with additional shape or opacity inputs or a different
blend mode), the backdrop’s contribution is included only once.
For color, the backdrop removal is accomplished by an explicit calculation, whose
effect is essentially the reverse of compositing with the Normal blend mode. The
formula is a simpliﬁcation of the following formulas, which present this opera-
tion more intuitively:
             ( 1 – αg ) × α0
                               n
     φ b = --------------------------------------
                                                -
           Union ( α 0 , α g )
                                              n
           Cn – φb × C0
      C = -------------------------------
                   1 – φb
where φb is the backdrop fraction, the relative contribution of the backdrop color
to the overall color.
For shape and alpha, backdrop removal is accomplished by maintaining two sets
of variables to hold the accumulated values. The group shape and alpha,
f g and α g , accumulate only the shape and alpha of the group elements, exclud-
   i         i
ing the group backdrop; their ﬁnal values become the group results returned by
the group compositing function. The complete alpha, αi , includes the backdrop
contribution as well; its value is used in the color compositing computations.
(There is never any need to compute the corresponding complete shape, fi , that
includes the backdrop contribution.)
As a result of these corrections, the effect of compositing objects as a group is the
same as that of compositing them separately (without grouping) if the following
conditions hold:
• The group is non-isolated and has the same knockout attribute as its parent
   group (see Sections 7.3.4, “Isolated Groups,” and 7.3.5, “Knockout Groups”).
• When compositing the group’s results with the group backdrop, the Normal
   blend mode is used and the shape and opacity inputs are always 1.0.
7.3.4 Isolated Groups
      An isolated group is one whose elements are composited onto a fully transparent
      initial backdrop rather than onto the group’s backdrop. The resulting source
      color, object shape, and object alpha for the group are therefore independent of
      the group backdrop. The only interaction with the group backdrop occurs when
      the group’s computed color, shape, and alpha are then composited with it.
      In particular, the special effects produced by the blend modes of objects within
      the group take into account only the intrinsic colors and opacities of those ob-
      jects; they are not inﬂuenced by the group’s backdrop. For example, applying the
      Multiply blend mode to an object in the group will produce a darkening effect on
      other objects lower in the group’s stack, but not on the group’s backdrop.
      Plate 17 illustrates this effect for a group consisting of four overlapping circles in
      a light gray color (C = M = Y = 0.0; K = 0.15). The circles are painted within the
      group with opacity 1.0 in the Multiply blend mode; the group itself is painted
      against its backdrop in Normal blend mode. In the top row, the group is isolated
      and thus does not interact with the rainbow backdrop; in the bottom row, it is
      non-isolated and composites with the backdrop. The plate also illustrates the dif-
      ference between knockout and non-knockout groups (see Section 7.3.5, “Knock-
      out Groups”).
      The effect of an isolated group can be represented by a simple object that directly
      speciﬁes a color, shape, and opacity at each point. This so-called “ﬂattening” of
      an isolated group is sometimes useful for importing and exporting fully com-
      posited artwork in applications. Furthermore, a group that speciﬁes an explicit
      blending color space must be an isolated group.
      For an isolated group, the group compositing formulas are altered by simply add-
      ing one statement to the initialization:
          α 0 = 0.0        if the group is isolated
      That is, the initial backdrop on which the elements of the group are composited
      is transparent, rather than inherited from the group’s backdrop. This substitution
      also makes C0 undeﬁned, but the normal compositing formulas take care of that.
      Also, the result computation for C automatically simpliﬁes to C = Cn , since there
      is no backdrop contribution to be factored out.
7.3.5 Knockout Groups
      In a knockout group, each individual element is composited with the group’s
      initial backdrop, rather than with the stack of preceding elements in the group.
      When objects have binary shapes (1.0 for “inside,” 0.0 for “outside”), each object
      overwrites (“knocks out”) the effects of any earlier elements it overlaps within the
      same group. At any given point, only the topmost object enclosing the point con-
      tributes to the result color and opacity of the group as a whole.
      Plate 17, already discussed above in Section 7.3.4, “Isolated Groups,” illustrates
      the difference between knockout and non-knockout groups. In the left column,
      the four overlapping circles are deﬁned as a knockout group and therefore do not
      composite with each other within the group; in the right column, they form a
      non-knockout group and thus do composite with each other. In each column, the
      upper and lower ﬁgures depict an isolated and a non-isolated group, respectively.
      This model is similar to the opaque imaging model, except that the “topmost
      object wins” rule applies to both the color and the opacity. Knockout groups are
      useful in composing a piece of artwork from a collection of overlapping objects,
      where the topmost object in any overlap completely obscures those beneath. At
      the same time, the topmost object interacts with the group’s initial backdrop in
      the usual way, with its opacity and blend mode applied as appropriate.
      The concept of “knockout” is generalized to accommodate fractional shape val-
      ues. In that case, the immediate backdrop is only partially knocked out and re-
      placed by only a fraction of the result of compositing the object with the initial
      backdrop.
      The restated group compositing formulas deal with knockout groups by intro-
      ducing a new variable, b, which is a subscript that speciﬁes which previous result
      to use as the backdrop in the compositing computations: 0 in a knockout group
      or i − 1 in a non-knockout group. When b = i − 1, the formulas simplify to the
      ones given in Section 7.3.3, “Group Compositing Computations.”
      In the general case, the computation proceeds in two stages:
      1. Composite the object with the group’s initial backdrop, but disregarding the
         object’s shape and using a source shape value of 1.0 everywhere. This produces
         unnormalized temporary alpha and color results, αt and Ct . (For color, this
   computation is essentially the same as the unsimpliﬁed color compositing for-
   mula given in Section 7.2.5, “Interpretation of Alpha,” but using a source
   shape of 1.0.)
       α t = Union ( α g , q s )
                                     b         i
       Ct = ( 1 – qs ) × αb × Cb + qs × ( ( 1 – αb ) × Cs + αb × Bi ( Cb , Cs ) )
                            i                                           i                       i i
2. Compute a weighted average of this result with the object’s immediate back-
   drop, using the source shape as the weighting factor. Then normalize the result
   color by the result alpha:
       αg = ( 1 – fs ) × αg                             + fs × αt
          i                  i                i–1                 i
        α i = Union ( α 0 , α g )
                                                 i
              ( 1 – fs ) × αi – 1 × Ci – 1 + fs × αt
                             i                                                      i
        C i = ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                              -
                                                     αi
This averaging computation is performed for both color and alpha. The formulas
above show this averaging directly; those in Section 7.3.7, “Summary of Group
Compositing Computations,” are slightly altered to use source shape and alpha
rather than source shape and opacity, avoiding the need to compute a source
opacity value explicitly. (Note that Ct there is slightly different from Ct above: it is
premultiplied by f s .)
                            i
The extreme values of the source shape produce the straightforward knockout
effect. That is, a shape value of 1.0 (“inside”) yields the color and opacity that re-
sult from compositing the object with the initial backdrop. A shape value of 0.0
(“outside”) leaves the previous group results unchanged. The existence of the
knockout feature is the main reason for maintaining a separate shape value,
rather than only a single alpha that combines shape and opacity. The separate
shape value must be computed in any group that is subsequently used as an ele-
ment of a knockout group.
A knockout group can be isolated or non-isolated; that is, isolated and knockout
are independent attributes. A non-isolated knockout group composites its top-
most enclosing element with the group’s backdrop; an isolated knockout group
composites the element with a transparent backdrop.
      Note: When a non-isolated group is nested within a knockout group, the initial
      backdrop of the inner group is the same as that of the outer group; it is not the im-
      mediate backdrop of the inner group. This behavior, although perhaps unexpected, is
      a consequence of the group compositing formulas when b = 0.
7.3.6 Page Group
      All of the elements painted directly onto a page—both top-level groups and top-
      level objects that are not part of any group—are treated as if they were contained
      in a transparency group P, which in turn is composited with a context-dependent
      backdrop. This group is called the page group.
      The page group can be treated in two distinctly different ways:
      • Ordinarily, the page is imposed directly on an output medium, such as paper
        or a display screen. The page group is treated as an isolated group, whose re-
        sults are then composited with a backdrop color appropriate for the medium.
        The backdrop is nominally white, although varying according to the actual
        properties of the medium. However, some applications may choose to provide
        a different backdrop, such as a checkerboard or grid to aid in visualizing the
        effects of transparency in the artwork.
      • A “page” of a PDF ﬁle can be treated as a graphics object to be used as an ele-
        ment of a page of some other document. This case arises, for example, when
        placing a PDF ﬁle containing a piece of artwork produced by Illustrator into a
        page layout produced by InDesign™. In this situation, the PDF “page” is not
        composited with the media color; instead, it is treated as an ordinary transpar-
        ency group, which can be either isolated or non-isolated and is composited
        with its backdrop in the normal way.
      The remainder of this section pertains only to the ﬁrst use of the page group,
      where it is to be imposed directly on the medium.
      The color C of the page at a given point is deﬁned by a simpliﬁcation of the gen-
      eral group compositing formula:
         〈 C g , f g , α g 〉 = Composite (U, 0, P )
                          C = ( 1 – αg ) × W + αg × Cg
where the variables have the meanings shown in Table 7.9. The ﬁrst formula
computes the color and alpha for the group given a transparent backdrop—in
effect, treating P as an isolated group. The second formula composites the results
with the context-dependent backdrop (using the equivalent of the Normal blend
mode).

                      on the properties of the medium or the needs of the application)
   U                  An undeﬁned color (which is not used, since the α0 argument of
                      Composite is 0)
If not otherwise speciﬁed, the page group’s color space is inherited from the
native color space of the output device—that is, a device color space, such as
DeviceRGB or DeviceCMYK. It is often preferable to specify an explicit color
space, particularly a CIE-based space, to ensure more predictable results of the
compositing computations within the page group. In this case, all page-level
compositing is done in the speciﬁed color space, with the entire result then con-
verted to the native color space of the output device before being composited
with the context-dependent backdrop. This case also arises when the page is not
actually being rendered but is converted to a “ﬂattened” representation in an
opaque imaging model, such as PostScript.
7.3.7 Summary of Group Compositing Computations
      The following restatement of the group compositing formulas also takes isolated
      groups and knockout groups into account. See Tables 7.7 and 7.8 on pages 429
      and 431 for the meanings of the variables.

      Note: Once again, keep in mind that these formulas are in their most general form.
      They can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed when some sources of shape and opacity are not
      present or when shape and opacity need not be maintained separately. Furthermore,
      in each speciﬁc type of group (isolated or not, knockout or not), some terms of these
      formulas cancel or drop out. An efﬁcient implementation should use the simpliﬁed
      derived formulas.
 7.4 Soft Masks
      As stated in earlier sections, the shape and opacity values used in compositing an
      object can include components called the mask shape (fm) and mask opacity
      (qm), which originate from a source independent of the object itself. Such an in-
      dependent source, called a soft mask, deﬁnes values that can vary across different
      points on the page. The word soft emphasizes that the mask value at a given point
      is not limited to just 0.0 or 1.0, but can take on intermediate fractional values as
      well. Such a mask is typically the only means of providing position-dependent
      opacity values, since elementary objects do not have intrinsic opacity of their
      own.
      A mask used as a source of shape values is also called a soft clip, by analogy with
      the “hard” clipping path of the opaque imaging model (see Section 4.4.3, “Clip-
      ping Path Operators”). The soft clip is a generalization of the hard clip: a hard
      clip can be represented as a soft clip having shape values of 1.0 inside and 0.0 out-
      side the clipping path. Everywhere inside a hard clipping path, the source object’s
      color replaces the backdrop; everywhere outside, the backdrop shows through
      unchanged. With a soft clip, by contrast, a gradual transition can be created be-
      tween an object and its backdrop, as in a vignette.
      A mask can be deﬁned by creating a transparency group and painting objects into
      it, thereby deﬁning color, shape, and opacity in the usual way. The resulting
      group can then be used to derive the mask in either of two ways, as described in
      the following sections.
7.4.1 Deriving a Soft Mask from Group Alpha
      In the ﬁrst method of deﬁning a soft mask, the color, shape, and opacity of a
      transparency group G are ﬁrst computed by the usual formula
          〈 C, f, α 〉 = Composite ( C 0 , α 0 , G )
      where C0 and α0 represent an arbitrary backdrop whose value does not contrib-
      ute to the eventual result. The C, f, and α results are the group’s color, shape, and
      alpha, respectively, with the backdrop factored out.
      The mask value at each point is then derived from the alpha of the group. Since
      the group’s color is not used in this case, there is no need to compute it. The alpha
      value is passed through a separately speciﬁed transfer function, allowing the
      masking effect to be customized.
7.4.2 Deriving a Soft Mask from Group Luminosity
      The second method of deriving a soft mask from a transparency group begins by
      compositing the group with a fully opaque backdrop of some selected color. The
      mask value at any given point is then deﬁned to be the luminosity of the resulting
      color. This allows the mask to be derived from the shape and color of an arbitrary
      piece of artwork drawn with ordinary painting operators.
      The color C used to create the mask from a group G is deﬁned by
          〈 C g , f g , α g 〉 = Composite ( C 0 , 1, G )
                           C = ( 1 – αg ) × C0 + αg × Cg
      where C0 is the selected backdrop color.
      G can be any kind of group—isolated or not, knockout or not—producing vari-
      ous effects on the C result in each case. The color C is then converted to luminos-
      ity in one of the following ways, depending on the group’s color space:
      • For CIE-based spaces, convert to the CIE 1931 XYZ space and use the Y com-
         ponent as the luminosity. This produces a colorimetrically correct luminosity.
         In the case of a PDF CalRGB space, the formula is
                               GR            GG            GB
            Y = YA × A             + YB × B       + YC × C
         using components of the Gamma and Matrix entries of the color space diction-
         ary (see Table 4.14 on page 185). An analogous computation applies to other
         CIE-based color spaces.
      • For device color spaces, convert the color to DeviceGray by device-dependent
         means and use the resulting gray value as the luminosity, with no compensa-
         tion for gamma or other color calibration. This method makes no pretense of
         colorimetric correctness; it merely provides a numerically simple means to
         produce continuous-tone mask values. Here are some recommended formulas
         for converting from DeviceRGB and DeviceCMYK, respectively:
             Y = 0.30 × R + 0.59 × G + 0.11 × B
             Y = 0.30 × ( 1 – C ) × ( 1 – K )
                       + 0.59 × ( 1 – M ) × ( 1 – K )
                       + 0.11 × ( 1 – Y ) × ( 1 – K )
      Following this conversion, the result is passed through a separately speciﬁed
      transfer function, allowing the masking effect to be customized.
      The backdrop color most likely to be useful is black, which causes any areas out-
      side the group’s shape to end up with zero luminosity values in the resulting
      mask. If the contents of the group are viewed as a positive mask, this produces the
      results that would be expected with respect to points outside the shape.
 7.5 Specifying Transparency in PDF
      The preceding sections have presented the transparent imaging model at an
      abstract level, with little mention of its representation in PDF. This section
      describes the facilities available for specifying transparency in PDF 1.4.
7.5.1 Specifying Source and Backdrop Colors
      Single graphics objects, as deﬁned in Section 4.1, “Graphics Objects,” are treated
      as elementary objects for transparency compositing purposes (subject to special
      treatment for text objects, as described in Section 5.2.7, “Text Knockout”). That
      is, all of a given object is considered to be one element of a transparency stack;
      portions of an object are not composited with one another, even if they are de-
      scribed in a way that would seem to cause overlaps (such as a self-intersecting
      path, combined ﬁll and stroke of a path, or a shading pattern containing an
      overlap or fold-over). An object’s source color Cs , used in the color compositing
      formula, is speciﬁed in the same way as in the opaque imaging model: via the
      current color in the graphics state or the source samples in an image. The back-
      drop color Cb is the result of previous painting operations.
7.5.2 Specifying Blending Color Space and Blend Mode
      The blending color space is an attribute of the transparency group within which
      an object is painted; its speciﬁcation is described below in Section 7.5.5, “Trans-
      parency Group XObjects.” The page as a whole is also treated as a group, the page
      group (see Section 7.3.6, “Page Group”), with a color space attribute of its own. If
      not otherwise speciﬁed, the page group’s color space is inherited from the native
      color space of the output device.
      The blend mode B(Cb , Cs ) is determined by the current blend mode parameter in
      the graphics state (see Section 4.3, “Graphics State”), set via the BM entry in a
      graphics state parameter dictionary (Section 4.3.4, “Graphics State Parameter
      Dictionaries”). Its value is either a name object, designating one of the standard
      blend modes listed in Tables 7.2 and 7.3 on pages 417 and 419, or an array of such
      names. In the latter case, the viewer application should use the ﬁrst blend mode
      in the array that it recognizes (or Normal if it recognizes none of them). This
      allows new blend modes to be introduced in the future while providing reason-
      able fallback behavior by viewer applications that do not recognize them. (See
      implementation note 52 in Appendix H.)
      Note: The current blend mode always applies to process color components, but only
      sometimes to spot colorants; see “Blend Modes and Overprinting” on page 459 for
      details.
7.5.3 Specifying Shape and Opacity
      As discussed under “Source Shape and Opacity” on page 421, the shape (f) and
      opacity (q) values used in the compositing computation can come from a variety
      of sources:
      • The intrinsic shape (fj ) and opacity (qj ) of the object being composited
      • A separate shape (fm ) or opacity (qm ) mask independent of the object itself
      • A scalar shape (fk ) or opacity (qk ) constant to be added at every point
      The following sections describe how each of these shape and opacity sources are
      speciﬁed in PDF.
Object Shape and Opacity
The shape value fj of an object painted with PDF painting operators is deﬁned as
follows:
• For objects deﬁned by a path or a glyph and painted in a uniform color with a
  path-painting or text-showing operator (Sections 4.4.2, “Path-Painting Opera-
  tors,” and 5.3.2, “Text-Showing Operators”), the shape is always 1.0 inside and
  0.0 outside the path.
• For images (Section 4.8, “Images”), the shape is nominally 1.0 inside the image
  rectangle and 0.0 outside it; this can be further modiﬁed by an explicit or color
  key mask (“Explicit Masking” on page 277 and “Color Key Masking” on page
  277).
• For image masks (“Stencil Masking” on page 276), the shape is 1.0 for painted
  areas and 0.0 for masked areas.
• For objects painted with a tiling pattern (Section 4.6.2, “Tiling Patterns”) or a
  shading pattern (Section 4.6.3, “Shading Patterns), the shape is further con-
  strained by the objects that deﬁne the pattern (see Section 7.5.6, “Patterns and
  Transparency”).
• For objects painted with the sh operator (“Shading Operator” on page 232),
  the shape is 1.0 inside and 0.0 outside the bounds of the shading’s painting
  geometry, disregarding the Background entry in the shading dictionary (see
  “Shading Dictionaries” on page 233).
All elementary objects have an intrinsic opacity qj of 1.0 everywhere. Any desired
opacity less than 1.0 must be applied by means of an opacity mask or constant, as
described in the following sections.
Mask Shape and Opacity
At most one mask input—called a soft mask, or alpha mask—can be provided to
any PDF compositing operation. The mask can serve as a source of either shape
(fm ) or opacity (qm ) values, depending on the setting of the alpha source parame-
ter in the graphics state (see Section 4.3, “Graphics State”). This is a boolean ﬂag,
set with the AIS (“alpha is shape”) entry in a graphics state parameter dictionary
(Section 4.3.4, “Graphics State Parameter Dictionaries”): true if the soft mask
contains shape values, false for opacity.
The soft mask can be speciﬁed in either of two ways:
• The current soft mask parameter in the graphics state, set with the SMask entry
   in a graphics state parameter dictionary, contains a soft-mask dictionary (see
   “Soft-Mask Dictionaries” on page 445) deﬁning the contents of the mask. The
   name None may be speciﬁed in place of a soft-mask dictionary, denoting the
   absence of a soft mask; in this case, the mask shape or opacity is implicitly 1.0
   everywhere. (See implementation note 52 in Appendix H.)
• An image XObject can contain its own soft-mask image in the form of a subsid-
   iary image XObject in the SMask entry of the image dictionary (see Section
   4.8.4, “Image Dictionaries”). This mask, if present, overrides any explicit or
   color key mask speciﬁed by the image dictionary’s Mask entry; either form of
   mask in the image dictionary overrides the current soft mask in the graphics
   state. (See implementation note 53 in Appendix H.)
Note: The current soft mask in the graphics state is intended to be used to clip only a
single object at a time (either an elementary object or a transparency group). If a soft
mask is applied when painting two or more overlapping objects, the effect of the
mask will multiply with itself in the area of overlap (except in a knockout group),
producing a result shape or opacity that is probably not what is intended. To apply a
soft mask to multiple objects, it is usually best to deﬁne the objects as a transparency
group and apply the mask to the group as a whole. These considerations also apply
to the current alpha constant (see the next section).
Constant Shape and Opacity
The current alpha constant parameter in the graphics state (see Section 4.3,
“Graphics State”) speciﬁes two scalar values—one for strokes and one for all
other painting operations—to be used for the constant shape (fk) or constant
opacity (qk) component in the color compositing formulas. This parameter can
be thought of as analogous to the current color used when painting elementary
objects. (Note, however, that the nonstroking alpha constant is also applied when
painting a transparency group’s results onto its backdrop; see also implementa-
tion note 52 in Appendix H.)
The stroking and nonstroking alpha constants are set, respectively, by the CA and
ca entries in a graphics state parameter dictionary (see Section 4.3.4, “Graphics
State Parameter Dictionaries”). As described above for the soft mask, the alpha
source ﬂag in the graphics state determines whether the alpha constants are inter-
preted as shape values (true) or opacity values (false).
      Note: The note at the end of “Mask Shape and Opacity,” above, applies to the current
      alpha constant parameter as well as the current soft mask.
7.5.4 Specifying Soft Masks
      As noted under “Mask Shape and Opacity” on page 443, soft masks for use in
      compositing computations can be speciﬁed in either of two ways: as a soft-mask
      dictionary in the current soft mask parameter of the graphics state or as a soft-
      mask image associated with a sampled image. The following sections describe
      these two methods of specifying soft masks in more detail.
      Soft-Mask Dictionaries
      The most common way of deﬁning a soft mask is with a soft-mask dictionary
      speciﬁed as the current soft mask in the graphics state (see Section 4.3, “Graphics
      State”). Table 7.10 shows the contents of this type of dictionary. (See implemen-
      tation note 52 in Appendix H.)
      The mask values are derived from those of a transparency group, using one of the
      two methods described in Sections 7.4.1, “Deriving a Soft Mask from Group
      Alpha,” and 7.4.2, “Deriving a Soft Mask from Group Luminosity.” The group is
      deﬁned by a transparency group XObject (see Section 7.5.5, “Transparency
      Group XObjects”) designated by the G entry in the soft-mask dictionary. The S
      (subtype) entry speciﬁes which of the two derivation methods to use:
      • If the subtype is Alpha, the transparency group XObject G is evaluated to com-
        pute a group alpha only; the colors of the constituent objects are ignored and
        the color compositing computations are not performed. The transfer function
        TR is then applied to the computed group alpha to produce the mask values.
        Outside the bounding box of the transparency group, the mask value is the re-
        sult of applying the transfer function to the input value 0.0.
      • If the subtype is Luminosity, the transparency group XObject G is composited
        with a fully opaque backdrop whose color is everywhere deﬁned by the soft-
        mask dictionary’s BC entry. The computed result color is then converted to a
        single-component luminosity value and the transfer function TR is applied to
        this luminosity to produce the mask values. Outside the transparency group’s
        bounding box, the mask value is derived by transforming the BC color to lumi-
        nosity and applying the transfer function to the result.

                                                                                                    identity function. Default value: Identity.
     The mask’s coordinate system is deﬁned by concatenating the transformation
     matrix speciﬁed by the Matrix entry in the transparency group’s form diction-
     ary (see Section 4.9.1, “Form Dictionaries”) with the current transformation
     matrix at the moment the soft mask is established in the graphics state with the
     gs operator.
Note: In a transparency group XObject that deﬁnes a soft mask, spot color compo-
nents are never available, even if they are available in the group or page on which the
soft mask is used. If the group XObject’s content stream speciﬁes a Separation or
DeviceN color space that uses spot color components, the alternate color space will be
substituted (see “Separation Color Spaces” on page 201 and “DeviceN Color Spaces”
on page 205).
Soft-Mask Images
The second way to deﬁne a soft mask is by associating a soft-mask image with an
image XObject. This is a subsidiary image XObject speciﬁed in the SMask entry
of the parent XObject’s image dictionary (see Section 4.8.4, “Image Dictionaries”;
see also implementation note 53 in Appendix H). Entries in the subsidiary image
dictionary for such a soft-mask image have the same format and meaning as in
that of an ordinary image XObject (as described in Table 4.35 on page 267), sub-
ject to the restrictions listed in Table 7.11. This type of image dictionary can also
optionally contain an additional entry, Matte, discussed below.
When an image is accompanied by a soft-mask image, it is sometimes advanta-
geous for the image data to be preblended with some background color, called the
matte color. Each image sample represents a weighted average of the original
source color and the matte color, using the corresponding mask sample as the
weighting factor. (This is a generalization of a technique commonly called “pre-
multiplied alpha.”)
If the image data is preblended, the matte color must be speciﬁed by a Matte
entry in the soft-mask image dictionary (see Table 7.12). The preblending com-
putation, performed independently for each component, is as follows:
    c' = m + α × ( c – m )
where
   c′ is the value to be provided in the image source data
   c is the original image component value
   m is the matte color component value
   α is the corresponding mask sample
Note: This computation uses actual color component values, with the effects of the
Filter and Decode transformations already performed. The computation is the same
whether the color space is additive or subtractive.

                                                                                                    blended.
        When preblended image data is used in transparency blending and compositing
        computations, the results are the same as if the original, unblended image data
        were used and no matte color were speciﬁed. In particular, the inputs to the blend
        function are the original color values. This may sometimes require the viewer
        application to invert the formula shown above in order to derive c from c′. If the
        resulting c value lies outside the range of color component values for the image
        color space, the results are unpredictable.
        The preblending computation is done in the color space speciﬁed by the parent
        image’s ColorSpace entry. This is independent of the group color space into
        which the image may be painted; if a color conversion is required, inversion of
        the preblending must precede the color conversion. If the image color space is an
        Indexed space (see “Indexed Color Spaces” on page 199), it is the color values in
        the color table (not the index values themselves) that are preblended.
  7.5.5 Transparency Group XObjects
        A transparency group is represented in PDF as a special type of group XObject
        (see Section 4.9.2, “Group XObjects”) called a transparency group XObject. A
        group XObject is in turn a type of form XObject, distinguished by the presence of
        a Group entry in its form dictionary (see Section 4.9.1, “Form Dictionaries”). The
        value of this entry is a subsidiary group attributes dictionary deﬁning the proper-
        ties of the group. The format and meaning of the dictionary’s contents are deter-
        mined by its group subtype, speciﬁed by the dictionary’s S entry; those for a
        transparency group (subtype Transparency) are shown in Table 7.13.
        Note: A page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87) may also have a Group entry,
        whose value is a group attributes dictionary specifying the attributes of the page
    group (see Section 7.3.6, “Page Group”). Some of the dictionary entries are inter-
    preted slightly differently for a page group than for a transparency group XObject; see
    their descriptions in the table for details.

                                                                                                    effectively isolated regardless of the I value, and the speciﬁed CS value is there-
                                                                                                    fore honored. But if the page is in turn used as an element of some other page
                                                                                                    and if the group is non-isolated, CS is ignored and the color space is inherited
                                                                                                    from the actual backdrop with which the page is composited (see Section 7.3.6,
                                                                                                    “Page Group”).
                       Default value: the color space of the parent group or page into which this trans-
                       parency group is painted. (The parent’s color space in turn can be either explic-
                       itly speciﬁed or inherited.)
                       Note: For a transparency group XObject used as an annotation appearance (see
                       Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”), the default color space is inherited from the
                       page on which the annotation appears.
I boolean              (Optional) A ﬂag specifying whether the transparency group is isolated (see Sec-
                       tion 7.3.4, “Isolated Groups”). If this ﬂag is true, objects within the group are
                       composited against a fully transparent initial backdrop; if false, they are com-
                       posited against the group’s backdrop. Default value: false.
                       In the group attributes dictionary for a page, the interpretation of this entry is
                       slightly altered. In the normal case in which the page is imposed directly on the
                       output medium, the page group is effectively isolated and the speciﬁed I value is
                       ignored. But if the page is in turn used as an element of some other page, it is
                       treated as if it were a transparency group XObject; the I value is interpreted in
                       the normal way to determine whether the page group is isolated.
K boolean              (Optional) A ﬂag specifying whether the transparency group is a knockout
                       group (see Section 7.3.5, “Knockout Groups”). If this ﬂag is false, later objects
                       within the group are composited with earlier ones with which they overlap; if
                       true, they are composited with the group’s initial backdrop and overwrite
                       (“knock out”) any earlier overlapping objects. Default value: false.
  The transparency group XObject’s content stream deﬁnes the graphics objects
  belonging to the group. Invoking the Do operator on the XObject executes its
  content stream and composites the resulting group color, shape, and opacity into
  the group’s parent group or page as if they had come from an elementary graph-
  ics object. When applied to a transparency group XObject, Do performs the fol-
  lowing actions in addition to the normal ones for a form XObject (as described in
  Section 4.9, “Form XObjects”):
  • If the transparency group is non-isolated (the value of the I entry in its group
    attributes dictionary is false), its initial backdrop, within the bounding box
    speciﬁed by the XObject’s BBox entry, is deﬁned to be the accumulated color
    and alpha of the parent group or page—that is, the result of everything that has
    been painted in the parent up to that point. (However, if the parent is a knock-
    out group, the initial backdrop is the same as that of the parent.) If the group is
    isolated (I is true), its initial backdrop is deﬁned to be transparent.
• Before execution of the transparency group XObject’s content stream, the cur-
  rent blend mode in the graphics state is initialized to Normal, the current strok-
  ing and nonstroking alpha constants to 1.0, and the current soft mask to None.
  Note: The purpose of initializing these graphics state parameters at the beginning
  of execution is to ensure that they are not applied twice: once when member objects
  are painted into the group and again when the group itself is painted into the par-
  ent group or page.
• Objects painted by operators in the transparency group XObject’s content
  stream are composited into the group according to the rules described in Sec-
  tion 7.2.2, “Basic Compositing Formula.” The knockout ﬂag (K) in the group
  attributes dictionary and the transparency-related parameters of the graphics
  state contribute to this computation.
• If a group color space (CS) is speciﬁed in the group attributes dictionary, all
  painting operators convert source colors to that color space before compositing
  objects into the group, and the resulting color at each point is interpreted in
  that color space. If no group color space is speciﬁed, the prevailing color space
  is dynamically inherited from the parent group or page. (If not otherwise
  speciﬁed, the page group’s color space is inherited from the native color space
  of the output device.)
• After execution of the transparency group XObject’s content stream, the graph-
  ics state reverts to its former state before the invocation of the Do operator (as
  it does for any form XObject). The group’s shape—the union of all objects
  painted into the group, clipped by the group XObject’s bounding box—is then
  painted into the parent group or page, using the group’s accumulated color and
  opacity at each point.
Note: If the Do operator is invoked more than once for a given transparency group
XObject, each invocation is treated as a separate transparency group. That is, the
result is as if the group were independently composited with the backdrop on each
invocation. Viewer applications that perform caching of rendered form XObjects
must take this requirement into account.
The actions described above occur only for a transparency group XObject—a
form XObject having a Group entry designating a group attributes subdictionary
whose group subtype (S) is Transparency. An ordinary form XObject—one hav-
ing no Group entry—is not subject to any grouping behavior for transparency
purposes. That is, the graphics objects it contains are composited individually,
just as if they were painted directly into the parent group or page.
7.5.6 Patterns and Transparency
      In the transparent imaging model, the graphics objects making up the pattern
      cell of a tiling pattern (see Section 4.6.2, “Tiling Patterns”) can include trans-
      parent objects and transparency groups. Transparent compositing can occur both
      within the pattern cell and between it and the backdrop wherever the pattern is
      painted. Similarly, a shading pattern (Section 4.6.3, “Shading Patterns”) com-
      posites with its backdrop as if the shading dictionary were applied with the sh
      operator.
      In both cases, the pattern deﬁnition is treated as if it were implicitly enclosed in a
      non-isolated transparency group: a non-knockout group for tiling patterns, a
      knockout group for shading patterns. The deﬁnition does not inherit the current
      values of the graphics state parameters at the time it is evaluated; these take effect
      only when the resulting pattern is later used to paint an object. Instead, the
      graphics state parameters are initialized as follows:
      • As always for transparency groups, those parameters related to transparency
        (blend mode, soft mask, and alpha constant) are initialized to their standard
        default values.
      • All other parameters are initialized to their values at the beginning of the con-
        tent stream (such as a page or a form XObject) in which the pattern is deﬁned
        as a resource; this is simply the normal behavior for all patterns, in both the
        opaque and transparent imaging models.
      • In the case of a shading pattern, the parameter values may be augmented by the
        contents of the ExtGState entry in the pattern dictionary (see Section 4.6.3,
        “Shading Patterns”). Only those parameters that affect the sh operator, such as
        the current transformation matrix and rendering intent, are used; parameters
        that affect path-painting operators are not, since the execution of sh does not
        entail painting a path.
      • If the shading dictionary has a Background entry, the pattern’s implicit trans-
        parency group is ﬁlled with the speciﬁed background color before the sh oper-
        ator is invoked.
      When the pattern is later used to paint a graphics object, the color, shape, and
      opacity values resulting from the evaluation of the pattern deﬁnition are used as
      the object’s source color (Cs ), object shape (fj ), and object opacity (qj ) in the
      transparency compositing formulas. This painting operation is subject to the
      values of the graphics state parameters in effect at the time, just as in painting an
      object with a constant color.
      Unlike the opaque imaging model, in which the pattern cell of a tiling pattern can
      be evaluated once and then replicated indeﬁnitely to ﬁll the painted area, the
      effect in the general transparent case is as if the pattern deﬁnition were reexe-
      cuted independently for each tile, taking into account the color of the backdrop
      at each point. However, in the common case in which the pattern consists entirely
      of objects painted with the Normal blend mode, this behavior can be optimized
      by treating the pattern cell as if it were an isolated group. Since in this case the
      results depend only on the color, shape, and opacity of the pattern cell itself and
      not on those of the backdrop, the pattern cell can be evaluated once and then rep-
      licated, just as in opaque painting.
      Note: In a raster-based implementation of tiling, it is important that all tiles together
      be treated as a single transparency group. This avoids artifacts due to multiple mark-
      ing of pixels along the boundaries between adjacent tiles.
      The foregoing discussion applies to both colored (PaintType 1) and uncolored
      (PaintType 2) tiling patterns. In the latter case, the restriction that an uncolored
      pattern’s deﬁnition may not specify colors extends as well to any transparency
      group that the deﬁnition may include. There are no corresponding restrictions,
      however, on specifying transparency-related parameters in the graphics state.
 7.6 Color Space and Rendering Issues
      This section describes the interactions between transparency and other aspects of
      color speciﬁcation and rendering in the Adobe imaging model.
7.6.1 Color Spaces for Transparency Groups
      As discussed in Section 7.5.5, “Transparency Group XObjects,” a transparency
      group can either have an explicitly declared color space of its own or inherit that
      of its parent group. In either case, the colors of source objects within the group
      are converted to the group’s color space, if necessary, and all blending and com-
      positing computations are done in that space (see Section 7.2.3, “Blending Color
      Space”). The resulting colors are then interpreted in that color space when the
      group is subsequently composited with its backdrop.
Under this arrangement, it is envisioned that all or most of a given piece of art-
work will be created in a single color space—most likely, the working color space
of the application generating it. The use of multiple color spaces typically will
arise only when assembling independently produced artwork onto a page. After
all the artwork has been placed on the page, the conversion from the group’s
color space to the page’s device color space will be done as the last step, without
any further transparency compositing. The transparent imaging model does not
require that this convention be followed, however; the reason for adopting it is to
avoid the loss of color information and the introduction of errors resulting from
unnecessary color space conversions.
Only an isolated group may have an explicitly declared color space of its own;
non-isolated groups must inherit their color space from the parent group (sub-
ject to special treatment for the page group, as described in Section 7.3.6, “Page
Group”). This is because the use of an explicit color space in a non-isolated group
would require converting colors from the backdrop’s color space to that of the
group in order to perform the compositing computations. Such conversion may
not be possible (since some color conversions can be performed only in one
direction), and even if possible, it would entail an excessive number of color con-
versions.
The choice of a group color space will have signiﬁcant effects on the results that
are produced. In particular:
• As noted in Section 7.2.3, “Blending Color Space,” the results of compositing in
   a device color space will be device-dependent; in order for the compositing
   computations to work in a device-independent way, the group’s color space
   must be CIE-based.
• A consequence of choosing a CIE-based group color space is that only CIE-
   based spaces can be used to specify the colors of objects within the group. This
   is because conversion from device to CIE-based colors is not possible in gener-
   al; the deﬁned conversions work only in the opposite direction. See below for
   further discussion.
• The compositing computations and blend functions generally compute linear
   combinations of color component values, on the assumption that the compo-
   nent values themselves are linear. For this reason, it is usually best to choose a
   group color space that has a linear gamma function. If a nonlinear color space
   is chosen, the results will still be well-deﬁned, but the appearance may not
         match the user’s expectations. Note, in particular, that the CIE-based sRGB
         color space (see page 192) is nonlinear, and hence may be unsuitable for use as
         a group color space.
      Note: Implementations of the transparent imaging model are advised to use as much
      precision as possible in representing colors during compositing computations and in
      the accumulated group results. To minimize the accumulation of roundoff errors and
      avoid additional errors arising from the use of linear group color spaces, more pre-
      cision is needed for intermediate results than is typically used to represent either the
      original source data or the ﬁnal rasterized results.
      If a group’s color space—whether speciﬁed explicitly or inherited from the parent
      group—is CIE-based, any use of device color spaces for painting objects is sub-
      ject to special treatment. Device colors cannot be painted directly into such a
      group, since there is no generally deﬁned method for converting them to the CIE-
      based color space. This problem arises in the following cases:
      •  DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, and DeviceCMYK color spaces, unless remapped to de-
         fault CIE-based color spaces (see “Default Color Spaces” on page 194)
      • Operators (such as rg) that specify a device color space implicitly, unless that
         space is remapped
      • Special color spaces whose base or underlying space is a device color space, un-
         less that space is remapped
      It is recommended that the default color space remapping mechanism always be
      employed when deﬁning a transparency group whose color space is CIE-based. If
      a device color is speciﬁed and is not remapped, it will be converted to the CIE-
      based color space in an implementation-dependent fashion, producing unpre-
      dictable results.
7.6.2 Spot Colors and Transparency
      The foregoing discussion of color spaces has been concerned with process colors—
      those produced by combinations of an output device’s process colorants. Process
      colors may be speciﬁed directly in the device’s native color space (such as Device-
      CMYK), or they may be produced by conversion from some other color space,
      such as a CIE-based (CalRGB or ICCBased) space. Whatever means is used to
      specify them, process colors are subject to conversion to and from the group’s
      color space.
A spot color is an additional color component, independent of those used to pro-
duce process colors. It may represent either an additional separation to be
produced or an additional colorant to be applied to the composite page (see
“Separation Color Spaces” on page 201 and “DeviceN Color Spaces” on page
205). The color component value, or tint, for a spot color speciﬁes the concentra-
tion of the corresponding spot colorant. Tints are conventionally represented as
subtractive, rather than additive, values.
Spot colors are inherently device-dependent and are not always available. In the
opaque imaging model, each use of a spot color component in a Separation or
DeviceN color space is accompanied by an alternate color space and a tint transfor-
mation function for mapping tint values into that space. This enables the color to
be approximated with process colorants when the corresponding spot colorant is
not available on the device.
Spot colors can be accommodated straightforwardly in the transparent imaging
model (except for issues relating to overprinting, discussed in Section 7.6.3,
“Overprinting and Transparency”). When an object is painted transparently with
a spot color component that is available in the output device, that color is com-
posited with the corresponding spot color component of the backdrop, indepen-
dently of the compositing that is performed for process colors. A spot color
retains its own identity; it is not subject to conversion to or from the color space
of the enclosing transparency group or page. If the object is an element of a trans-
parency group, one of two things can happen:
• The group maintains a separate color value for each spot color component,
   independently of the group’s color space. In effect, the spot color passes directly
   through the group hierarchy to the device, with no color conversions per-
   formed; however, it is still subject to blending and compositing with other ob-
   jects that use the same spot color.
• The spot color is converted to its alternate color space. The resulting color is
   then subject to the usual compositing rules for process colors. In particular,
   spot colors are never available in a transparency group XObject that is used to
   deﬁne a soft mask; the alternate color space will always be substituted in that
   case.
Only a single shape value and opacity value are maintained at each point in the
computed group results; they apply to both process and spot color components.
In effect, every object is considered to paint every existing color component, both
process and spot. Where no value has been explicitly speciﬁed for a given com-
      ponent in a given object, an additive value of 1.0 (or a subtractive tint value of
      0.0) is assumed. For instance, when painting an object with a color speciﬁed in a
      DeviceCMYK or ICCBased color space, the process color components are painted
      as speciﬁed and the spot color components are painted with an additive value of
      1.0. Likewise, when painting an object with a color speciﬁed in a Separation color
      space, the named spot color is painted as speciﬁed and all other components
      (both process colors and other spot colors) are painted with an additive value of
      1.0. The consequences of this are discussed in Section 7.6.3, “Overprinting and
      Transparency.”
      The opaque imaging model also allows process color components to be addressed
      individually, as if they were spot colors. For instance, it is possible to specify a
      Separation color space named Cyan, which paints just the cyan component on a
      CMYK output device. However, this capability is very difﬁcult to extend to trans-
      parency groups. In general, the color components in a group are not the process
      colorants themselves, but are converted to process colorants only after the com-
      pletion of all color compositing computations for the group (and perhaps some
      of its parent groups as well). For instance, if the group’s color space is ICCBased,
      the group has no Cyan component to be painted. Consequently, treating a pro-
      cess color component as if it were a spot color is permitted only within a group
      that inherits the native color space of the output device. Attempting to do so in a
      group that speciﬁes its own color space will result in conversion of the requested
      spot color to its alternate color space.
7.6.3 Overprinting and Transparency
      In the opaque imaging model, overprinting is controlled by two parameters of
      the graphics state: the overprint parameter and the overprint mode (see Section
      4.5.6, “Overprint Control”). Painting an object causes some speciﬁc set of device
      colorants to be marked, as determined by the current color space and current
      color in the graphics state. The remaining colorants are either erased or left un-
      changed, depending on whether the overprint parameter is false or true. When
      the current color space is DeviceCMYK, the overprint mode parameter addition-
      ally enables this selective marking of colorants to be applied to individual color
      components according to whether the component value is zero or nonzero.
      Because this model of overprinting deals directly with the painting of device
      colorants, independently of the color space in which source colors have been
      speciﬁed, it is highly device-dependent and primarily addresses production needs
      rather than design intent. Overprinting is usually reserved for opaque colorants
or for very dark colors, such as black. It is also invoked during late-stage produc-
tion operations such as trapping (see Section 9.10.5, “Trapping Support”), when
the actual set of device colorants has already been determined.
Consequently, it is best to think of transparency as taking place in appearance
space, but overprinting of device colorants in device space. This means that
colorant overprint decisions should be made at output time, based on the actual
resultant colorants of any transparency compositing operation. On the other
hand, effects similar to overprinting can be achieved in a device-independent
manner by taking advantage of blend modes, as described in the next section.
Blend Modes and Overprinting
As stated in Section 7.6.2, “Spot Colors and Transparency,” each graphics object
painted affects all existing color components: all of the process colorants in the
transparency group’s color space as well as any available spot colorants. For color
components whose value has not been speciﬁed, a source color value of 1.0 is
assumed; when objects are fully opaque and the Normal blend mode is used, this
has the effect of erasing those components. This treatment is consistent with the
behavior of the opaque imaging model with the overprint parameter set to false.
The transparent imaging model deﬁnes some blend modes, such as Darken, that
can be used to achieve effects similar to overprinting. The blend function for
Darken is
    B ( c b, c s ) = min ( c b, c s )
In this blend mode, the result of compositing will always be the same as the back-
drop color when the source color is 1.0, as it is for all unspeciﬁed color com-
ponents. When the backdrop is fully opaque, this leaves the result color
unchanged from that of the backdrop. This is consistent with the behavior of the
opaque imaging model with the overprint parameter set to true.
If the object or backdrop is not fully opaque, the actions described above are al-
tered accordingly. That is, the erasing effect is reduced, and overprinting an ob-
ject with a color value of 1.0 may affect the result color. While these results may
or may not be useful, they lie outside the realm of the overprinting and erasing
behavior deﬁned in the opaque imaging model.
When process colors are overprinted or erased (because a spot color is being
painted), the blending computations described above are done independently for
each component in the group’s color space. If that space is different from the
native color space of the output device, its components are not the device’s actual
process colorants; the blending computations affect the process colorants only
after the group’s results are converted to the device color space. Thus the effect is
different from that of overprinting or erasing the device’s process colorants
directly. On the other hand, this is a fully general operation that works uniformly,
regardless of the type of object or of the computations that produced the source
color.
The discussion so far has focused on those color components whose values are
not speciﬁed and that are to be either erased or left unchanged. However, the
Normal or Darken blend modes used for these purposes may not be suitable for
use on those components whose color values are speciﬁed. In particular, using
the Darken blend mode for such components would preclude overprinting a dark
color with a lighter one. Moreover, some other blend mode may be speciﬁcally
desired for those components.
The PDF graphics state speciﬁes only one current blend mode parameter, which
always applies to process colorants and sometimes to spot colorants as well.
Speciﬁcally, only separable, white-preserving blend modes can be used for spot
colors. A blend mode is white-preserving if its blend function B has the property
that B(1.0, 1.0) = 1.0. (Of the standard separable blend modes listed in Table 7.2
on page 417, all except Difference and Exclusion are white-preserving.) If the
speciﬁed blend mode is not separable and white-preserving, it applies only to
process color components; the Normal blend mode is substituted for spot colors.
This ensures that when objects accumulate in an isolated transparency group, the
accumulated values for unspeciﬁed components remain 1.0 so long as only
white-preserving blend modes are used. The group’s results can then be over-
printed using Darken (or other useful modes) while avoiding unwanted interac-
tions with components whose values were never speciﬁed within the group.
Compatibility with Opaque Overprinting
Because the use of blend modes to achieve effects similar to overprinting does not
make direct use of the overprint control parameters in the graphics state, such
methods are usable only by transparency-aware applications. For compatibility
with the methods of overprint control used in the opaque imaging model, a spe-
cial blend mode, CompatibleOverprint, is provided that consults the overprint-
related graphics state parameters to compute its result. This mode applies only
when painting elementary graphics objects (ﬁlls, strokes, text, images, and shad-
ings). It is never invoked explicitly and is not identiﬁed by any PDF name object;
rather, it is implicitly invoked whenever an elementary graphics object is painted
while overprinting is enabled (that is, when the overprint parameter in the
graphics state is true).
Note: Earlier designs of the transparent imaging model included an additional blend
mode named Compatible, which explicitly invoked the CompatibleOverprint blend
mode described here. Because CompatibleOverprint is now invoked implicitly when-
ever appropriate, it is never necessary to specify the Compatible blend mode for use
in compositing. It is still recognized as a valid blend mode for the sake of compatibil-
ity, but is simply treated as equivalent to Normal.
The value of the blend function B(cb , cs ) in the CompatibleOverprint mode is
either cb or cs , depending on the setting of the overprint mode parameter, the
current and group color spaces, and the source color value cs :
• If the overprint mode is 1 (nonzero overprint mode) and the current color
   space and group color space are both DeviceCMYK, then only process color
   components with nonzero values replace the corresponding component values
   of the backdrop; all other component values leave the existing backdrop value
   unchanged. That is, the value of the blend function B(cb , cs ) is the source com-
   ponent cs for any process (DeviceCMYK) color component whose (subtractive)
   color value is nonzero; otherwise it is the backdrop component cb . For spot
   color components, the value is always cb .
• In all other cases, the value of B(cb , cs ) is cs for all color components speciﬁed
   in the current color space, otherwise cb . For instance, if the current color space
   is DeviceCMYK or CalRGB, the value of the blend function is cs for process color
   components and cb for spot components. On the other hand, if the current
   color space is a Separation space representing a spot color component, the
   value is cs for that spot component and cb for all process components and all
   other spot components.
Note: In the descriptions above, the term current color space refers to the color space
used for a painting operation. This may be speciﬁed by the current color space
parameter in the graphics state (see Section 4.5.1, “Color Values”), implicitly by color
operators such as rg (Section 4.5.7, “Color Operators”), or by the ColorSpace entry
of an image XObject (Section 4.8.4, “Image Dictionaries”). In the case of an Indexed
space, it refers to the base color space (see “Indexed Color Spaces” on page 199); like-
wise for Separation and DeviceN spaces that revert to their alternate color space, as
described under “Separation Color Spaces” on page 201 and “DeviceN Color Spaces”
on page 205.
If the current blend mode when CompatibleOverprint is invoked is any mode
other than Normal, the object being painted is implicitly treated as if it were
deﬁned in a non-isolated, non-knockout transparency group and painted using
the CompatibleOverprint blend mode; the group’s results are then painted using
the current blend mode in the graphics state.
Note: It is not necessary to create such an implicit transparency group if the current
blend mode is Normal; simply substituting the CompatibleOverprint blend mode
while painting the object produces equivalent results. There are some additional
cases in which the implicit transparency group can be optimized out.
Plate 20 shows the effects of all four possible combinations of blending and over-
printing, using the Screen blend mode in the DeviceCMYK color space. The label
“overprint enabled” means that the overprint parameter in the graphics state is
true and the overprint mode is 1. In the upper half of the ﬁgure, a light green oval
is painted opaquely (opacity = 1.0) over a backdrop shading from pure yellow to
pure magenta. In the lower half, the same object is painted with transparency
(opacity = 0.5).
Special Path-Painting Considerations
The overprinting considerations discussed above also affect those path-painting
operations that combine ﬁlling and stroking a path in a single operation. These
include the B, B*, b, and b* operators (see Section 4.4.2, “Path-Painting Opera-
tors”) and the painting of glyphs with text rendering mode 2 or 6 (Section 5.2.5,
“Text Rendering Mode”). For transparency compositing purposes, the combined
ﬁll and stroke are treated as a single graphics object, as if they were enclosed in a
transparency group. This implicit group is established and used as follows:
• If overprinting is enabled (the overprint parameter in the graphics state is true)
   and the current stroking and nonstroking alpha constants are equal, a non-
   isolated, non-knockout transparency group is established. Within the group,
   the ﬁll and stroke are performed with an alpha value of 1.0 but with the
   CompatibleOverprint blend mode. The group results are then composited with
   the backdrop using the originally speciﬁed alpha and blend mode.
• In all other cases, a non-isolated knockout group is established. Within the
   group, the ﬁll and stroke are performed with their respective prevailing alpha
   constants and the prevailing blend mode. The group results are then compos-
   ited with the backdrop using an alpha value of 1.0 and the Normal blend mode.
Note that in the case of showing text with the combined ﬁlling and stroking text
rendering modes, this behavior is independent of the text knockout parameter in
the graphics state (see Section 5.2.7, “Text Knockout”).
The purpose of these rules is to avoid having a non-opaque stroke composite
with the result of the ﬁll in the region of overlap, which would produce a “double
border” effect that is usually undesirable. The special case that applies when the
overprint parameter is true is for backward compatibility with the overprinting
behavior of the opaque imaging model. If a desired effect cannot be achieved
with a combined ﬁlling and stroking operator or text rendering mode, it can be
achieved by specifying the ﬁll and stroke with separate path objects and an ex-
plicit transparency group.
Note: Overprinting of the stroke over the ﬁll does not work in the second case de-
scribed above (although either the ﬁll or the stroke can still overprint the backdrop).
Furthermore, if the overprint graphics state parameter is true, the results are discon-
tinuous at the transition between equal and unequal values of the stroking and non-
stroking alpha constants. For this reason, it is best not to use overprinting for
combined ﬁlling and stroking operations if the stroking and nonstroking alpha con-
stants are being varied independently.
Summary of Overprinting Behavior
Tables 7.14 and 7.15 summarize the overprinting and erasing behavior in the
opaque and transparent imaging models, respectively. Table 7.14 shows the over-
printing rules used in the opaque model, as described in Section 4.5.6, “Over-
print Control”; Table 7.15 shows the equivalent rules as implemented by the
CompatibleOverprint blend mode in the transparent model. The names OP and
OPM in the tables refer to the overprint and overprint mode parameters of the
graphics state.

          Color component values are represented in these tables as subtractive tint values,
          because overprinting is typically applied to subtractive colorants such as inks,
          rather than to additive ones such as phosphors on a display screen. The
          CompatibleOverprint blend mode is therefore described as if it took subtractive
          arguments and returned subtractive results. In reality, however, Compatible-
          Overprint (like all blend modes) treats color components as additive values;
          subtractive components must be complemented before and after application of
          the blend function.
          Note an important difference between the two tables. In Table 7.14, the process
          color components being discussed are the actual device colorants—the color
          components of the output device’s native color space (DeviceGray, DeviceRGB, or
          DeviceCMYK). In Table 7.15, the process color components are those of the
          group’s color space, which is not necessarily the same as that of the output device
          (and can even be something like CalRGB or ICCBased). For this reason, the pro-
          cess color components of the group color space cannot be treated as if they were
          spot colors in a Separation or DeviceN color space (see Section 7.6.2, “Spot
      Colors and Transparency”). This difference between opaque and transparent
      overprinting and erasing rules arises only within a transparency group (including
      the page group, if its color space is different from the native color space of the
      output device). There is no difference in the treatment of spot color components.
      Table 7.15 has one additional row at the bottom. It applies when painting an ob-
      ject that is itself a transparency group rather than an elementary object (ﬁll,
      stroke, text, image, or shading). As stated in Section 7.6.2, “Spot Colors and
      Transparency,” a group is considered to paint all color components, both process
      and spot. Color components that were not explicitly painted by any object in the
      group have an additive color value of 1.0 (subtractive tint 0.0). Since no informa-
      tion is retained about which components were actually painted within the group,
      compatible overprinting is not possible in this case; the CompatibleOverprint
      blend mode reverts to Normal, with no consideration of the overprint and over-
      print mode parameters. (Note that a transparency-aware application can choose
      a more suitable blend mode, such as Darken, if it desires to produce an effect sim-
      ilar to overprinting.)
7.6.4 Rendering Parameters and Transparency
      The opaque imaging model has several graphics state parameters dealing with the
      rendering of color: the current halftone (see Section 6.4.4, “Halftone Diction-
      aries”), transfer functions (Section 6.3, “Transfer Functions”), rendering intent
      (“Rendering Intents” on page 197), and black-generation and undercolor-removal
      functions (Section 6.2.3, “Conversion from DeviceRGB to DeviceCMYK”). All of
      these rendering parameters can be speciﬁed on a per-object basis; they control
      how a particular object will be rendered. When all objects are opaque, it is easy to
      deﬁne what this means. But when they are transparent, more than one object can
      contribute to the color at a given point; it is unclear which rendering parameters
      to apply in an area where transparent objects overlap. At the same time, the trans-
      parent imaging model should be consistent with the opaque model when only
      opaque objects are painted.
      Furthermore, some of the rendering parameters—the halftone and transfer func-
      tions, in particular—can be applied only when the ﬁnal color at a given point is
      known. In the presence of transparency, these parameters must be treated some-
      what differently from those (rendering intent, black generation, and undercolor
      removal) that apply whenever colors must be converted from one color space to
      another. When objects are transparent, the rendering of an object does not occur
      when the object is speciﬁed, but at some later time; hence for rendering param-
eters in the former category, the implementation must keep track of the render-
ing parameters at each point from the time they are speciﬁed until the time the
rendering actually occurs. This means that these rendering parameters must be
associated with regions of the page rather than with individual objects.
Halftone and Transfer Function
The halftone and transfer function to be used at any given point on the page are
those in effect at the time of painting the last (topmost) elementary graphics ob-
ject enclosing that point, but only if the object is fully opaque. (Only elementary
objects are relevant; the rendering parameters associated with a group object are
ignored.) The topmost object at any point is deﬁned to be the topmost elementary
object in the entire page stack that has a nonzero object shape value (fj ) at that
point (that is, for which the point is inside the object). An object is considered to
be fully opaque if all of the following conditions hold at the time the object is
painted:
• The current alpha constant in the graphics state (stroking or nonstroking, de-
  pending on the painting operation) is 1.0.
• The current blend mode in the graphics state is Normal (or Compatible, which
  is treated as equivalent to Normal).
• The current soft mask in the graphics state is None. If the object is an image
  XObject, there is no SMask entry in its image dictionary.
• The foregoing three conditions were also true at the time the Do operator was
  invoked for the group containing the object, as well as for any direct ancestor
  groups.
• If the current color is a tiling pattern, all objects in the deﬁnition of its pattern
  cell also satisfy the foregoing conditions.
Taken together, these conditions ensure that only the object itself contributes to
the color at the given point, completely obscuring the backdrop. For portions of
the page whose topmost object is not fully opaque or that are never painted at all,
the default halftone and transfer function for the page are used.
Note: If a graphics object is painted with overprinting enabled—that is, if the applic-
able (stroking or nonstroking) overprint parameter in the graphics state is true—the
halftone and transfer function to use at a given point must be determined indepen-
dently for each color component. Overprinting implicitly invokes the Compatible-
Overprint blend mode (see “Compatibility with Opaque Overprinting” on page
460). An object is considered opaque for a given component only if Compatible-
Overprint yields the source color (not the backdrop color) for that component.
Rendering Intent and Color Conversions
The rendering intent, black-generation, and undercolor-removal parameters
need to be handled somewhat differently. The rendering intent inﬂuences the
conversion from a CIE-based color space to a target color space, taking into ac-
count the target space’s color gamut (the range of colors it can reproduce).
Whereas in the opaque imaging model the target space is always the native color
space of the output device, in the transparent model it may instead be the group
color space of a transparency group into which an object is being painted.
The rendering intent is needed at the moment such a conversion must be per-
formed—that is, when painting an elementary or group object speciﬁed in a CIE-
based color space into a parent group having a different color space. This differs
from the current halftone and transfer function, whose values are used only when
all color compositing has been completed and rasterization is being performed.
In all cases, the rendering intent to use for converting an object’s color (whether
that of an elementary object or of a transparency group) is determined by the
rendering intent parameter associated with the object. In particular:
• When painting an elementary object with a CIE-based color into a transpar-
   ency group having a different color space, the rendering intent used is the cur-
   rent rendering intent in effect in the graphics state at the time of the painting
   operation.
• When painting a transparency group whose color space is CIE-based into a
   parent group having a different color space, the rendering intent used is the
   current rendering intent in effect at the time the Do operator is applied to the
   group.
• When the color space of the page group is CIE-based, the rendering intent used
   to convert colors to the native color space of the output device is the default
   rendering intent for the page.
Note: Since there may be one or more nested transparency groups having different
CIE-based color spaces, the color of an elementary source object may be converted to
the device color space in multiple stages, controlled by the rendering intent in effect
      at each stage. The proper choice of rendering intent at each stage depends on the rel-
      ative gamuts of the source and target color spaces. It is speciﬁed explicitly by the doc-
      ument producer, not prescribed by the PDF speciﬁcation, since no single policy for
      managing rendering intents is appropriate for all situations.
      A similar approach works for the black-generation and undercolor-removal
      functions, which are applied only during conversion from DeviceRGB to Device-
      CMYK color spaces:
      • When painting an elementary object with a DeviceRGB color directly into a
         transparency group whose color space is DeviceCMYK, the functions used are
         the current black-generation and undercolor-removal functions in effect in the
         graphics state at the time of the painting operation.
      • When painting a transparency group whose color space is DeviceRGB into a
         parent group whose color space is DeviceCMYK, the functions used are the ones
         in effect at the time the Do operator is applied to the group.
      • When the color space of the page group is         DeviceRGB and the native color
         space of the output device is DeviceCMYK, the functions used to convert colors
         to the device’s color space are the default functions for the page.
7.6.5 PostScript Compatibility
      Because the PostScript language does not support the transparent imaging
      model, PDF 1.4 viewer applications must have some means for converting the
      appearance of a document that uses transparency into a purely opaque descrip-
      tion for printing on PostScript output devices. Similar techniques can also be
      used to convert such documents into a form that can be correctly viewed by
      PDF 1.3 and earlier viewers.
      Converting the contents of a page from transparent to opaque form entails some
      combination of shape decomposition and prerendering to “ﬂatten” the stack of
      transparent objects on the page, perform all the needed transparency computa-
      tions, and describe the ﬁnal appearance using opaque objects only. Whether the
      page contains transparent content needing to be ﬂattened can be determined by
      straightforward analysis of the page’s resources; it is not necessary to analyze the
      content stream itself. The conversion to opaque form is irreversible, since all in-
      formation about how the transparency effects were produced is lost.
In order to perform the transparency computations properly, the viewer applica-
tion needs to know the native color space of the output device. This is no prob-
lem when the viewer controls the output device directly. However, when
generating PostScript output, the viewer has no way of knowing the native color
space of the PostScript output device. An incorrect assumption will ruin the cali-
bration of any CIE-based colors appearing on the page. This problem can be
addressed in either of two ways:
• If the entire page consists of CIE-based colors, ﬂatten the colors to a single CIE-
   based color space rather than to a device color space. The preferred color space
   for this purpose can easily be determined if the page has a group attributes dic-
   tionary (Group entry in the page object) specifying a CIE-based color space
   (see Section 7.5.5, “Transparency Group XObjects”).
• Otherwise, ﬂatten the colors to some assumed device color space with pre-
   determined calibration. In the generated PostScript output, paint the ﬂattened
   colors in a CIE-based color space having that calibration.
Because the choice between using spot colorants and converting them to an alter-
nate color space affects the ﬂattened results of process colors, a decision must also
be made during PostScript conversion about the set of available spot colorants to
assume. (This differs from strictly opaque painting, where the decision can be
deferred until the generated PostScript code is executed.)

                     8Interactive Features
    THIS CHAPTER DESCRIBES those features of PDF that allow a user to interact
    with a document on the screen, using the mouse and keyboard. These include:
    • Preference settings to control the way the document is presented on the screen
       (Section 8.1, “Viewer Preferences”)
    • Navigation facilities for moving through the document in a variety of ways
       (Sections 8.2, “Document-Level Navigation,” and 8.3, “Page-Level Naviga-
       tion”)
    • Annotations for adding text notes, sounds, movies, and other ancillary infor-
       mation to the document (Section 8.4, “Annotations”)
    • Actions that can be triggered by speciﬁed events (Section 8.5, “Actions”)
    • Interactive forms for gathering information from the user (Section 8.6, “Inter-
       active Forms”)
    • Sounds to be played through the computer’s speakers (Section 8.7, “Sounds”)
    • Movies to be displayed on the screen (Section 8.8, “Movies”)
8.1 Viewer Preferences
    The ViewerPreferences entry in a document’s catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Docu-
    ment Catalog”) designates a viewer preferences dictionary (PDF 1.2) controlling
    the way the document is to be presented on the screen or in print. If no such dic-
    tionary is speciﬁed, viewer applications should behave in accordance with their
    own current user preference settings. Table 8.1 shows the contents of the viewer
    preferences dictionary. (See implementation note 54 in Appendix H.)

 8.2 Document-Level Navigation
      The features described in this section allow a PDF viewer application to present
      the user with an interactive, global overview of a document in either of two forms:
      • As a hierarchical outline showing the document’s internal structure
      • As a collection of thumbnail images representing the pages of the document in
         miniature form
      Each item in the outline or each thumbnail image can then be associated with a
      corresponding destination in the document, allowing the user to jump directly to
      that destination by clicking with the mouse.
8.2.1 Destinations
      A destination deﬁnes a particular view of a document, consisting of the following:
      • The page of the document to be displayed
      • The location of the document window on that page
      • The magniﬁcation (zoom) factor to use when displaying the page
      Destinations may be associated with outline items (see Section 8.2.2, “Document
      Outline”), annotations (“Link Annotations” on page 501), or actions (“Go-To
      Actions” on page 519 and “Remote Go-To Actions” on page 520). In each case,
      the destination speciﬁes the view of the document to be presented when the out-
      line item or annotation is opened or the action is performed. In addition, the op-
      tional OpenAction entry in a document’s catalog (Section 3.6.1, “Document
      Catalog”) may specify a destination to be displayed when the document is
      opened. A destination may be speciﬁed either explicitly, by an array of parame-
      ters deﬁning its properties, or indirectly by name.
      Explicit Destinations
      Table 8.2 shows the allowed syntactic forms for specifying a destination explicitly
      in a PDF ﬁle. In each case, page is an indirect reference to a page object. All coor-
      dinate values (left, right, top, and bottom) are expressed in the default user space
      coordinate system. The page’s bounding box is the smallest rectangle enclosing all
      of its contents. (If any side of the bounding box lies outside the page’s crop box,
            the corresponding side of the crop box is used instead; see Section 9.10.1, “Page
            Boundaries,” for further discussion of the crop box.)

SYNTAX                             MEANING
[page /XYZ left top zoom]          Display the page designated by page, with the coordinates (left, top) posi-
                                   tioned at the top-left corner of the window and the contents of the page mag-
                                   niﬁed by the factor zoom. A null value for any of the parameters left, top, or
                                   zoom speciﬁes that the current value of that parameter is to be retained un-
                                   changed. A zoom value of 0 has the same meaning as a null value.
[page /Fit]                        Display the page designated by page, with its contents magniﬁed just enough
                                   to ﬁt the entire page within the window both horizontally and vertically. If
                                   the required horizontal and vertical magniﬁcation factors are different, use
                                   the smaller of the two, centering the page within the window in the other
                                   dimension.
[page /FitH top]                   Display the page designated by page, with the vertical coordinate top posi-

                                   just enough to ﬁt the entire width of the page within the window.
[page /FitV left]                  Display the page designated by page, with the horizontal coordinate left posi-
                                   tioned at the left edge of the window and the contents of the page magniﬁed
                                   just enough to ﬁt the entire height of the page within the window.
[page /FitR left bottom right top] Display the page designated by page, with its contents magniﬁed just enough
                                   to ﬁt the rectangle speciﬁed by the coordinates left, bottom, right, and top
                                   entirely within the window both horizontally and vertically. If the required
                                   horizontal and vertical magniﬁcation factors are different, use the smaller of
                                   the two, centering the rectangle within the window in the other dimension.
[page /FitB]                       (PDF 1.1) Display the page designated by page, with its contents magniﬁed
                                   just enough to ﬁt its bounding box entirely within the window both hori-
                                   zontally and vertically. If the required horizontal and vertical magniﬁcation
                                   factors are different, use the smaller of the two, centering the bounding box
                                   within the window in the other dimension.
[page /FitBH top]                  (PDF 1.1) Display the page designated by page, with the vertical coordinate
                                   top positioned at the top edge of the window and the contents of the page
                                   magniﬁed just enough to ﬁt the entire width of its bounding box within the
                                   window.
[page /FitBV left]                 (PDF 1.1) Display the page designated by page, with the horizontal coordi-
                                   nate left positioned at the left edge of the window and the contents of the
                                   page magniﬁed just enough to ﬁt the entire height of its bounding box within
                                   the window.
Note: No page object can be speciﬁed for a destination associated with a remote go-to
action (see “Remote Go-To Actions” on page 520), because the destination page is in
a different PDF document. In this case, the page parameter speciﬁes a page number
within the remote document instead of a page object in the current document.
Named Destinations
Instead of being deﬁned directly, using the explicit syntax shown in Table 8.2, a
destination may be referred to indirectly, using a name object (PDF 1.1) or a
string (PDF 1.2). This capability is especially useful when the destination is lo-
cated in another PDF document. For example, a link to the beginning of Chapter
6 in another document might refer to the destination by a name such as
Chap6.begin instead of giving an explicit page number in the other document.
This would allow the location of the chapter opening to change within the other
document without invalidating the link. If an annotation or outline item that
refers to a named destination has an associated action, such as a remote go-to
action (see “Remote Go-To Actions” on page 520) or a thread action (“Thread
Actions” on page 522), the destination is in the ﬁle speciﬁed by the action’s F
entry, if any; if there is no F entry, the destination is in the current ﬁle.
In PDF 1.1, the correspondence between name objects and destinations is
deﬁned by the Dests entry in the document catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Docu-
ment Catalog”). The value of this entry is a dictionary in which each key is a des-
tination name and the corresponding value is either an array deﬁning the
destination, using the syntax shown in Table 8.2, or a dictionary with a D entry
whose value is such an array. The latter form allows additional attributes to be
associated with the destination, as well as enabling a go-to action (see “Go-To
Actions” on page 519) to be used as the target of a named destination.
In PDF 1.2, the correspondence between strings and destinations is deﬁned by
the Dests entry in the document’s name dictionary (see Section 3.6.3, “Name
Dictionary”). The value of this entry is a name tree (Section 3.8.4, “Name Trees”)
mapping name strings to destinations. (The keys in the name tree may be treated
as text strings for display purposes.) The destination value associated with a key
in the name tree may be either an array or a dictionary, as described in the pre-
ceding paragraph.
      Note: The use of strings as destination names is a PDF 1.2 feature. If compatibility
      with earlier versions of PDF is required, only name objects may be used to refer to
      named destinations. Where such compatibility is not a consideration, however, ap-
      plications that generate large numbers of named destinations should use the string
      form of representation instead, since there are essentially no implementation limits.
8.2.2 Document Outline
      A PDF document may optionally display a document outline on the screen, allow-
      ing the user to navigate interactively from one part of the document to another.
      The outline consists of a tree-structured hierarchy of outline items (sometimes
      called bookmarks), which serve as a “visual table of contents” to display the docu-
      ment’s structure to the user. The user can interactively open and close individual
      items by clicking them with the mouse. When an item is open, its immediate chil-
      dren in the hierarchy become visible on the screen; each child may in turn be
      open or closed, selectively revealing or hiding further parts of the hierarchy.
      When an item is closed, all of its descendants in the hierarchy are hidden. Click-
      ing the text of any visible item with the mouse activates the item, causing the
      viewer application to jump to a destination or trigger an action associated with
      the item.
      The root of a document’s outline hierarchy is an outline dictionary speciﬁed by
      the Outlines entry in the document catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Cata-
      log”). Table 8.3 shows the contents of this dictionary. Each individual outline
      item within the hierarchy is deﬁned by an outline item dictionary (Table 8.4). The
      items at each level of the hierarchy form a linked list, chained together through
      their Prev and Next entries and accessed through the First and Last entries in the
      parent item (or in the outline dictionary in the case of top-level items). When
      displayed on the screen, the items at a given level appear in the order in which
      they occur in the linked list. (See also implementation note 55 in Appendix H.)

8.2.3 Thumbnail Images
      A PDF document may deﬁne thumbnail images representing the contents of its
      pages in miniature form. A viewer application can then display these images on
      the screen, allowing the user to navigate to a page by clicking its thumbnail image
      with the mouse.
      Note: Thumbnail images are not required, and may be included for some pages and
      not for others.
      The thumbnail image for a page is an image XObject speciﬁed by the Thumb
      entry in the page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87). It has the usual struc-
      ture for an image dictionary (Section 4.8.4, “Image Dictionaries”), but only the
      Width, Height, ColorSpace, BitsPerComponent, and Decode entries are signiﬁ-
      cant; all of the other entries listed in Table 4.35 on page 267 are ignored if present.
      (If a Subtype entry is speciﬁed, its value must be Image.) The image’s color space
      must be either DeviceGray or DeviceRGB, or an Indexed space based on one of
      these. Example 8.2 shows a typical thumbnail image deﬁnition.

 8.3 Page-Level Navigation
      This section describes PDF facilities that allow the user to navigate from page to
      page within a document. These include:
      • Page labels for numbering or otherwise identifying individual pages
      • Article threads, which chain together items of content within the document that
        are logically connected but not physically sequential
      • Presentations that display the document in the form of a “slide show,” ad-
        vancing from one page to the next either automatically or under user control
      For another important form of page-level navigation, see “Link Annotations” on
      page 501.
8.3.1 Page Labels
      Each page in a PDF document is identiﬁed by an integer page index that expresses
      the page’s relative position within the document. In addition, a document may
      optionally deﬁne page labels (PDF 1.3) to identify each page visually on the screen
      or in print. Page labels and page indices need not coincide: the indices are ﬁxed,
      running consecutively through the document starting from 0 for the ﬁrst page,
      but the labels can be speciﬁed in any way that is appropriate for the particular
      document. For example, if the document begins with 12 pages of front matter
      numbered in roman numerals and the remainder of the document is numbered
      in arabic, then the ﬁrst page would have a page index of 0 and a page label of i, the
      twelfth page would have index 11 and label xii, and the thirteenth page would
      have index 12 and label 1.
For purposes of page labeling, a document can be divided into labeling ranges,
each of which is a series of consecutive pages using the same numbering system.
Pages within a range are numbered sequentially in ascending order. A page’s label
consists of a numeric portion based on its position within its labeling range,
optionally preceded by a label preﬁx denoting the range itself. For example, the
pages in an appendix might be labeled with decimal numeric portions preﬁxed
with the string A−; the resulting page labels would be A−1, A−2, and so on.
A document’s labeling ranges are deﬁned by the PageLabels entry in the docu-
ment catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Catalog”). The value of this entry is a
number tree (Section 3.8.5, “Number Trees”), each of whose keys is the page
index of the ﬁrst page in a labeling range; the corresponding value is a page label
dictionary deﬁning the labeling characteristics for the pages in that range. The
tree must include a value for page index 0. Table 8.6 shows the contents of a page
label dictionary. (See implementation note 57 in Appendix H.)
Example 8.3 shows a document with pages labeled
   i, ii, iii, iv, 1, 2, 3, A−8, A−9, …

   8.3.2 Articles
          Some types of document may contain sequences of content items that are logical-
          ly connected but not physically sequential. For example, a news story may begin
          on the ﬁrst page of a newsletter and run over onto one or more nonconsecutive
          interior pages. To represent such sequences of physically discontiguous but logi-
          cally related items, a PDF document may deﬁne one or more articles (PDF 1.1).
          The sequential ﬂow of an article is deﬁned by an article thread; the individual
          content items that make up the article are called beads on the thread. PDF viewer
          applications can provide navigation facilities to allow the user to follow a thread
          from one bead to the next.
          The optional Threads entry in the document catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Docu-
          ment Catalog”) holds an array of thread dictionaries (Table 8.7) deﬁning the doc-
          ument’s articles. Each individual bead within a thread is represented by a bead
          dictionary (Table 8.8). The thread dictionary’s F entry points to the ﬁrst bead in
          the thread; the beads are then chained together sequentially in a doubly linked list
     through their N (next) and V (previous) entries. In addition, for each page on
     which article beads appear, the page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87)
     should contain a B entry whose value is an array of indirect references to the
     beads on the page, in drawing order.

8.3.3 Presentations
      Some PDF viewer applications may allow a document to be displayed in the form
      of a presentation or “slide show,” advancing from one page to the next either auto-
      matically or under user control. A page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87)
      may contain two optional entries, Dur and Trans (PDF 1.1), to specify how to dis-
      play that page in presentation mode.
      The Dur entry in the page object speciﬁes the page’s display duration (also called
      its advance timing): the maximum length of time, in seconds, that the page will be
     displayed before the presentation automatically advances to the next page. (The
     user can advance the page manually before the speciﬁed time has expired.) If no
     Dur entry is speciﬁed in the page object, the page does not advance automatically.
     The Trans entry in the page object contains a transition dictionary describing the
     style and duration of the visual transition to use when moving from another page
     to the given page during a presentation. Table 8.9 shows the contents of the tran-
     sition dictionary. (Some of the entries shown are needed only for certain transi-
     tion styles, as indicated in the table.)

       Figure 8.1 illustrates the relationship between transition duration (D in the tran-

       transition duration speciﬁed for a page (page 2 in the ﬁgure) governs the transi-
       tion to that page from another page; the transition from the page is governed by
       the next page’s transition duration.

8.4 Annotations
    An annotation associates an object such as a note, sound, or movie with a loca-
    tion on a page of a PDF document, or provides a means of interacting with the
    user via the mouse and keyboard. PDF includes a wide variety of standard an-
    notation types, described in detail in Section 8.4.5, “Annotation Types.”
    Many of the standard annotation types may be displayed in either the open or the
    closed state. When closed, they appear on the page in some distinctive form de-
    pending on the speciﬁc annotation type, such as an icon, a box, or a rubber
    stamp. When the user activates the annotation by clicking it with the mouse, it
    exhibits its associated object, such as by opening a pop-up window displaying a
    text note (Figure 8.2) or by playing a sound or a movie.

                   years old and have a minimum of 500 employees.)
                          We asked each candidate company to distribute to
                   225 randomly selected employees the Great Place to Work
                   Trust Index. This employee survey was designed by the
                   Great Place to Work Institute of San Francisco to evaluate
                   trust in management, pride in work/company, and
                   camaraderie. Responses were returned directly to us.
                        Each company was also required to fill out the Hewitt
                   People Practices Inventory, a comprehensive 29-page
                   questionnaire designed by our partner in this project,
                   Hewitt Associates of Lincolnshire, Ill., a leading
                   management consulting firm. Finally we asked each of our
                   candidates to send us additional corporate materials, such

      The behavior of each annotation type is implemented by a software module
      called an annotation handler. Handlers for the standard annotation types are built
      directly into the PDF viewer application; handlers for additional types can be
      supplied as plug-in extensions.
8.4.1 Annotation Dictionaries
      The optional Annots entry in a page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87) holds
      an array of annotation dictionaries, each representing an annotation associated
      with the given page. Table 8.10 shows the required and optional entries that are
      common to all annotation dictionaries. The dictionary may contain additional
      entries speciﬁc to a particular annotation type; see the descriptions of individual
      annotation types in Section 8.4.5, “Annotation Types,” for details. (See also im-
      plementation note 58 in Appendix H.)

   8.4.2 Annotation Flags
           The value of the annotation dictionary’s F entry is an unsigned 32-bit integer
           containing ﬂags specifying various characteristics of the annotation. Bit positions
           within the ﬂag word are numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (high-order). Table
           8.11 shows the meanings of the ﬂags; all undeﬁned ﬂag bits are reserved and must
           be set to 0.

BIT POSITION NAME      MEANING
      1      Invisible If set, do not display the annotation if it does not belong to one of the standard
                       annotation types and no annotation handler is available. If clear, display such
                       an unknown annotation using an appearance stream speciﬁed by its appear-
                       ance dictionary, if any (see Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”).
      2      Hidden    (PDF 1.2) If set, do not display or print the annotation or allow it to interact
                       with the user, regardless of its annotation type or whether an annotation
                       handler is available. In cases where screen space is limited, the ability to hide
                       and show annotations selectively can be used in combination with appearance
                       streams (see Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”) to display auxiliary pop-up
                       information similar in function to online help systems. (See implementation
                       note 63 in Appendix H.)
      3      Print     (PDF 1.2) If set, print the annotation when the page is printed. If clear, never
                       print the annotation, regardless of whether it is displayed on the screen. This
                       can be useful, for example, for annotations representing interactive pushbut-
                       tons, which would serve no meaningful purpose on the printed page. (See
                       implementation note 63 in Appendix H.)
      4      NoZoom    (PDF 1.3) If set, do not scale the annotation’s appearance to match the magni-
                       ﬁcation of the page. The location of the annotation on the page (deﬁned by the
                       upper-left corner of its annotation rectangle) remains ﬁxed, regardless of the
                       page magniﬁcation. See below for further discussion.
      5      NoRotate  (PDF 1.3) If set, do not rotate the annotation’s appearance to match the rota-
                       tion of the page. The upper-left corner of the annotation rectangle remains in a
                       ﬁxed location on the page, regardless of the page rotation. See below for fur-
                       ther discussion.
      6      NoView    (PDF 1.3) If set, do not display the annotation on the screen or allow it to
                       interact with the user. The annotation may be printed (depending on the
                       setting of the Print ﬂag), but should be considered hidden for purposes of on-
                       screen display and user interaction.
      7      ReadOnly  (PDF 1.3) If set, do not allow the annotation to interact with the user. The
                       annotation may be displayed or printed (depending on the settings of the
                       NoView and Print ﬂags), but should not respond to mouse clicks or change its
                       appearance in response to mouse motions.
                       Note: This ﬂag is ignored for widget annotations; its function is subsumed by the
                       ReadOnly ﬂag of the associated form ﬁeld (see Table 8.50 on page 532).
If the NoZoom ﬂag is set, the annotation always maintains the same ﬁxed size on
the screen and is unaffected by the magniﬁcation level at which the page itself is
displayed. Similarly, if the NoRotate ﬂag is set, the annotation retains its original
orientation on the screen when the page is rotated (by changing the Rotate entry
in the page object; see “Page Objects” on page 87).
In either case, the annotation’s position is determined by the coordinates of the
upper-left corner of its annotation rectangle, as deﬁned by the Rect entry in the
annotation dictionary and interpreted in the default user space of the page. When
the default user space is scaled or rotated, the positions of the other three corners
of the annotation rectangle will be different in the altered user space than they
were in the original user space. The viewer application performs this alteration
automatically; however, it does not actually change the annotation’s Rect entry,
which continues to describe the annotation’s relationship with the unscaled, un-
rotated user space.
For example, Figure 8.3 shows how an annotation whose NoRotate ﬂag is set re-
mains upright when the page it is on is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The upper-
left corner of the annotation remains at the same point in default user space; the
annotation pivots around that point.

  8.4.3 Border Styles
        An annotation may optionally be surrounded by a border when displayed or
        printed. If present, the border is drawn completely inside the annotation rec-
        tangle. In PDF 1.1, the characteristics of the border are speciﬁed by the Border
        entry in the annotation dictionary (see Table 8.10 on page 490). Beginning with
        PDF 1.2, some types of annotation may instead specify their border characteris-
        tics in a border style dictionary designated by the annotation’s BS entry. Such dic-
        tionaries are also used to specify the width and dash pattern for the lines drawn
        by line, square, circle, and ink annotations. Table 8.12 summarizes the contents
        of the border style dictionary. If neither the Border nor the BS entry is present,
        the border is drawn as a solid line with a width of 1 point.

                                                                                                    as in the line dash pattern parameter of the graphics state (see “Line Dash Pattern” on
                                                                                                    page 155). The dash phase is not speciﬁed and is assumed to be 0. For example, a D
                                                                                                    entry of [3 2] speciﬁes a border drawn with 3-point dashes alternating with 2-point

      Note: In PDF 1.2 and 1.3, only widget annotations use border style dictionaries to
      specify their border styles; all of the other standard annotation types (see Table 8.14
      on page 499) use the Border entry instead. In PDF 1.4, all except link annotations
      use border style dictionaries.
8.4.4 Appearance Streams
      Beginning with PDF 1.2, an annotation can specify one or more appearance
      streams as an alternative to the simple border and color characteristics available
      in earlier versions. This allows the annotation to be presented visually on the page
      in different ways to reﬂect its interactions with the user. Each appearance stream
      is a form XObject (see Section 4.9, “Form XObjects”): a self-contained content
      stream to be rendered inside the annotation rectangle.
      Before rendering an appearance stream, the viewer application establishes a coor-
      dinate system whose origin is at the lower-left corner of the annotation rectangle.
      Nominally, the coordinates in this space are in default user space units; however,
      the space may be scaled or rotated with respect to the actual page coordinate sys-
      tem, depending on the values of the annotation’s NoZoom and NoRotate ﬂags
      (see Section 8.4.2, “Annotation Flags”). The form XObject’s Matrix entry should
      transform the form coordinate system into that of the annotation; the results are
      clipped to the annotation rectangle. All other elements of the graphics state are
      set to their default values.
      In PDF 1.4, an annotation appearance can include transparency if the appearance
      stream deﬁning it is a transparency group XObject (see Section 7.5.5, “Transpar-
      ency Group XObjects”). This transparency group is composited with a backdrop
      consisting of the page content along with any previously painted annotations.
      The ﬁnal compositing operation is performed using blend mode Normal, an
      alpha constant of 1.0 (or other value as speciﬁed by the CA entry in the annota-
      tion dictionary), and a soft mask of None.
      Note: If a transparent annotation appearance is painted over an annotation that is
      drawn without using an appearance stream, the effect is implementation-dependent.
      This is because such annotations are sometimes drawn by means that do not con-
      form to the Adobe imaging model. Also, the effect of highlighting a transparent
      annotation appearance is implementation-dependent.
        An annotation can deﬁne as many as three separate appearances:
        • The normal appearance is used when the annotation is not interacting with the
           user. This is also the appearance that is used for printing the annotation.
        • The rollover appearance is used when the user moves the cursor into the anno-
           tation’s active area without pressing the mouse button.
        • The down appearance is used when the mouse button is pressed or held down
           within the annotation’s active area.
        Note: As used here, the term mouse denotes a generic pointing device that controls
        the location of a cursor on the screen and has at least one button that can be pressed,
        held down, and released. See Section 8.5.2, “Trigger Events,” for further discussion.
        The normal, rollover, and down appearances are deﬁned in an appearance
        dictionary, which in turn is the value of the AP entry in the annotation dictionary
        (see Table 8.10 on page 490). Table 8.13 shows the contents of the appearance
        dictionary.
                             TABLE 8.13 Entries in an appearance dictionary

                                                                                                    the N entry.
D                                       stream or dictionary                                        (Optional) The annotation’s down appearance. Default value: the value of the
                                                                                                    N entry.
        Each entry in the appearance dictionary may contain either a single appearance
        stream or an appearance subdictionary. In the latter case, the subdictionary de-
        ﬁnes multiple appearance streams corresponding to different appearance states of
        the annotation.
      For example, an annotation representing an interactive checkbox might have two
      appearance states named On and Off. Its appearance dictionary might be deﬁned
      as follows:
          /AP << /N << /On    formXObject1
                         /Off  formXObject2
                     >>
                  /D << /On   formXObject3
                         /Off  formXObject4
                     >>
              >>
      where formXObject1 and formXObject2 deﬁne the checkbox’s normal appearance in
      its checked and unchecked states, while formXObject3 and formXObject4 provide
      visual feedback, such as emboldening its outline, when the user clicks it with the
      mouse. (No R entry is deﬁned because no special appearance is needed when the
      user moves the cursor over the checkbox without pressing the mouse button.)
      The choice between the checked and unchecked appearance states is determined
      by the AS entry in the annotation dictionary (see Table 8.10 on page 490).
      Note: Some of the standard PDF annotation types, such as movie annotations—as
      well as all custom annotation types deﬁned by third parties—are implemented
      through plug-in extensions. If the plug-in for a particular annotation type is not
      available, PDF viewer applications should display the annotation with its normal
      (N) appearance. Viewer applications should also attempt to provide reasonable be-
      havior (such as displaying nothing at all) if an annotation’s AS entry designates an
      appearance state for which no appearance is deﬁned in the appearance dictionary.
      For convenience in managing appearance streams that are used repeatedly, the AP
      entry in a PDF document’s name dictionary (see Section 3.6.3, “Name Diction-
      ary”) can contain a name tree mapping name strings to appearance streams. The
      name strings have no standard meanings; no PDF objects refer to appearance
      streams by name.
8.4.5 Annotation Types
      PDF supports the standard annotation types listed in Table 8.14. The following
      sections describe each of these types in detail. Plug-in extensions may add new
      annotation types, and further standard types may be added in the future. (See
      implementation note 65 in Appendix H.)

Text Annotations
A text annotation represents a “sticky note” attached to a point in the PDF docu-
ment. When closed, the annotation appears as an icon; when open, it displays a
pop-up window containing the text of the note, in a font and size chosen by the
viewer application. Text annotations do not scale and rotate with the page; they
         behave as if the NoZoom and NoRotate annotation ﬂags (see Table 8.11 on page
         493) were always set. Table 8.15 shows the annotation dictionary entries speciﬁc
         to this type of annotation.

         Link Annotations
         A link annotation represents either a hypertext link to a destination elsewhere in
         the document (see Section 8.2.1, “Destinations”) or an action to be performed
         (Section 8.5, “Actions”). Table 8.16 shows the annotation dictionary entries spe-

         Free Text Annotations
         A free text annotation (PDF 1.3) displays text directly on the page. Unlike an ordi-
         nary text annotation (see “Text Annotations” on page 499), a free text annotation
         has no open or closed state; instead of being displayed in a pop-up window, the
         text is always visible. Table 8.17 shows the annotation dictionary entries speciﬁc
         to this type of annotation.

         Line Annotations
         A line annotation (PDF 1.3) displays a single straight line on the page. When
         opened, it displays a pop-up window containing the text of the associated note.
         Table 8.18 shows the annotation dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of anno-
         tation.

          Square and Circle Annotations
          Square and circle annotations (PDF 1.3) display, respectively, a rectangle or an
          ellipse on the page. When opened, they display a pop-up window containing the
          text of the associated note. The rectangle or ellipse is inscribed within the annota-
          tion rectangle deﬁned by the annotation dictionary’s Rect entry (see Table 8.10
          on page 490); Figure 8.4 shows an example, using a border width of 18 points.
          Despite the names square and circle, the width and height of the annotation
          rectangle need not be equal. Table 8.20 shows the annotation dictionary entries
          speciﬁc to these types of annotation.

         Markup Annotations
         Markup annotations appear as highlights, underlines, strikeouts (all PDF 1.3), or
         jagged (“squiggly”) underlines (PDF 1.4) in the text of a document. When
         opened, they display a pop-up window containing the text of the associated note.

         Rubber Stamp Annotations
         A rubber stamp annotation (PDF 1.3) displays text or graphics intended to look as
         if they were stamped on the page with a rubber stamp. When opened, it displays a
         pop-up window containing the text of the associated note. Table 8.22 shows the
         annotation dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of annotation.

         Ink Annotations
         An ink annotation (PDF 1.3) represents a freehand “scribble” composed of one or
         more disjoint paths. When opened, it displays a pop-up window containing the
         text of the associated note. Table 8.23 shows the annotation dictionary entries

         Pop-up Annotations
         A pop-up annotation (PDF 1.3) displays text in a pop-up window for entry and
         editing. It typically does not appear alone, but is associated with another annota-
         tion, its parent annotation, and is used for editing the parent’s text. It has no
         appearance stream or associated actions of its own, and is identiﬁed by the Popup
         entry in the parent’s annotation dictionary (see Table 8.10 on page 490). Table
         8.24 shows the annotation dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of annotation.
         File Attachment Annotations
         A ﬁle attachment annotation (PDF 1.3) contains a reference to a ﬁle, which typi-
         cally will be embedded in the PDF ﬁle (see Section 3.10.3, “Embedded File
         Streams”). For example, a table of data might use a ﬁle attachment annotation to
         link to a spreadsheet ﬁle based on that data; activating the annotation will extract
         the embedded ﬁle and give the user an opportunity to view it or store it in the ﬁle
         system. Table 8.25 shows the annotation dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of
         annotation.

         Sound Annotations
         A sound annotation (PDF 1.2) is analogous to a text annotation, except that in-
         stead of a text note, it contains sound recorded from the computer’s microphone
         or imported from a ﬁle. When the annotation is activated, the sound is played.
         The annotation behaves like a text annotation in most ways, with a different icon
         (by default, a speaker) to indicate that it represents a sound. Table 8.26 shows the
         annotation dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of annotation; sounds them-
         selves are discussed in Section 8.7, “Sounds.”

         Movie Annotations
         A movie annotation (PDF 1.2) contains animated graphics and sound to be pre-
         sented on the computer screen and through the speakers. When the annotation is
         activated, the movie is played. Table 8.27 shows the annotation dictionary entries
         speciﬁc to this type of annotation; movies themselves are discussed in Section
         8.8, “Movies.” (See also implementation note 69 in Appendix H.)

         Widget Annotations
         Interactive forms (see Section 8.6, “Interactive Forms”) use widget annotations
         (PDF 1.2) to represent the appearance of ﬁelds and to manage user interactions.
         As a convenience, when a ﬁeld has only a single associated widget annotation, the
         contents of the ﬁeld dictionary (Section 8.6.2, “Field Dictionaries”) and the an-
         notation dictionary may be merged into a single dictionary containing entries
         that pertain to both a ﬁeld and an annotation. (This presents no ambiguity, since
         the contents of the two kinds of dictionary do not conﬂict.) Table 8.28 shows the
         annotation dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of annotation; interactive
         forms and ﬁelds are discussed at length in Section 8.6.

         Printer’s Mark Annotations
         A printer’s mark annotation (PDF 1.4) represents a graphic symbol, such as a
         registration target, color bar, or cut mark, added to a page to assist production
         personnel in identifying components of a multiple-plate job and maintaining
         consistent output during production. See Section 9.10.2, “Printer’s Marks,” for
         further discussion.
      Trap Network Annotations
      A trap network annotation (PDF 1.3) deﬁnes the trapping characteristics for a
      page of a PDF document. (Trapping is the process of adding marks to a page
      along color boundaries to avoid unwanted visual artifacts resulting from mis-
      registration of colorants when the page is printed.) A page may have at most one
      trap network annotation, whose Subtype entry has the value TrapNet and which
      is always the last element in the page object’s Annots array (see “Page Objects” on
      page 87). See Section 9.10.5, “Trapping Support,” for further discussion.
 8.5 Actions
      Instead of simply jumping to a destination in the document, an annotation or
      outline item can specify an action (PDF 1.1) for the viewer application to per-
      form, such as launching an application, playing a sound, or changing an annota-
      tion’s appearance state. The optional A entry in the annotation or outline item
      dictionary (see Tables 8.10 on page 490 and 8.4 on page 478) speciﬁes an action
      to be performed when the annotation or outline item is activated; in PDF 1.2, a
      variety of other circumstances may trigger an action as well (see Section 8.5.2,
      “Trigger Events”). In addition, the optional OpenAction entry in a document’s
      catalog (Section 3.6.1, “Document Catalog”) may specify an action to be per-
      formed when the document is opened. PDF includes a wide variety of standard
      action types, described in detail in Section 8.5.3, “Action Types.”

      8.29 shows the required and optional entries that are common to all action
      dictionaries. The dictionary may contain additional entries speciﬁc to a particu-
      lar action type; see the descriptions of individual action types in Section 8.5.3,
      “Action Types,” for details.

                                                                                                    formed after this one. The value is either a single action dictionary or an
                                                                                                    array of action dictionaries to be performed in order; see below for fur-
                                                                                                    ther discussion.
        The action dictionary’s Next entry (PDF 1.2) allows sequences of actions to be
        chained together. For example, the effect of clicking a link annotation with the
        mouse might be to play a sound, jump to a new page, and start up a movie. Note
        that the Next entry is not restricted to a single action, but may contain an array of
        actions, each of which in turn may have a Next entry of its own. The actions may
        thus form a tree instead of a simple linked list. Actions within each Next array are
        executed in order, each followed in turn by any actions speciﬁed in its Next entry,
        and so on recursively. Viewer applications should attempt to provide reasonable
        behavior in anomalous situations; for example, self-referential actions should not
        be executed more than once, and actions that close the document or otherwise
        render the next action impossible should terminate the execution sequence.
        Applications should also provide some mechanism for the user to interrupt and
        manually terminate a sequence of actions.
        Note: No action should modify its own action dictionary or any other in the action
        tree in which it resides. The effect of such modiﬁcation on subsequent execution of
        actions in the tree is undeﬁned.
  8.5.2 Trigger Events
        An annotation, page object, or (beginning with PDF 1.3) interactive form ﬁeld
        may include an entry named AA that speciﬁes an additional-actions dictionary
        (PDF 1.2), extending the set of events that can trigger the execution of an action.
        In PDF 1.4, the document catalog dictionary (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Cat-
       alog”) may also contain an AA entry for trigger events affecting the document as
       a whole. Tables 8.30 to 8.33 show the contents of this type of dictionary. (See
       implementation notes 70 and 71 in Appendix H.)

For purposes of the trigger events E (enter), X (exit), D (down), and U (up), the
term mouse denotes a generic pointing device with the following characteristics:
• A selection button that can be pressed, held down, and released. If there is more
   than one mouse button, this is typically the left button.
• A notion of location—that is, an indication of where on the screen the device is
   pointing. This is typically denoted by a screen cursor.
• A notion of focus—that is, which element in the document is currently inter-
   acting with the user. In many systems, this is denoted by a blinking caret, a
   focus rectangle, or a color change.
PDF viewer applications must ensure the presence of such a device in order for
the corresponding actions to be executed correctly. Mouse-related trigger events
are subject to the following constraints:
•  An E (enter) event can occur only when the mouse button is up.
•  An X (exit) event cannot occur without a preceding E event.
•  A U (up) event cannot occur without a preceding E and D event.
•  In the case of overlapping or nested annotations, entering a second annota-
   tion’s active area causes an X event to occur for the ﬁrst annotation.
Note: The ﬁeld-related trigger events K (keystroke), F (format), V (validate), and C
(calculate) are not deﬁned for button ﬁelds (see “Button Fields” on page 538). Note
that the effects of an action triggered by one of these events are limited only by the
action itself and can occur outside the described scope of the event. For example, even
though the F event is used to trigger actions that format ﬁeld values prior to display,
it is possible for an action triggered by this event to perform a calculation or make
any other modiﬁcation to the document.
Note also that these ﬁeld-related trigger events can occur either through user interac-
tion or programmatically, such as in response to the NeedAppearances entry in the
interactive form dictionary (see Section 8.6.1, “Interactive Form Dictionary”), im-
portation of FDF data (Section 8.6.6, “Forms Data Format”), or JavaScript actions
(“JavaScript Actions” on page 556). For example, the user’s modifying a ﬁeld value
can trigger a cascade of calculations and further formatting and validation for other
ﬁelds in the document.
8.5.3 Action Types
      PDF supports the standard action types listed in Table 8.34. The following sec-
      tions describe each of these types in detail. Plug-in extensions may add new
      action types.
                                      TABLE 8.34 Action types
      ACTION TYPE           DESCRIPTION
      GoTo                  Go to a destination in the current document.
      GoToR                 (“Go-to remote”) Go to a destination in another document.
      Launch                Launch an application, usually to open a ﬁle.
      Thread                Begin reading an article thread.
      URI                   Resolve a uniform resource identiﬁer.
      Sound                 (PDF 1.2) Play a sound.
      Movie                 (PDF 1.2) Play a movie.
      Hide                  (PDF 1.2) Set an annotation’s Hidden ﬂag.
      Named                 (PDF 1.2) Execute an action predeﬁned by the viewer application.
      SubmitForm            (PDF 1.2) Send data to a uniform resource locator.
      ResetForm             (PDF 1.2) Set ﬁelds to their default values.

      JavaScript            (PDF 1.3) Execute a JavaScript script.
      Note: Previous versions of the PDF speciﬁcation described an action type known as
      the set-state action; this type of action is now considered obsolete and its use is no
      longer recommended. An additional action type, the no-op action, was deﬁned in
      PDF 1.2 but never implemented; it is no longer deﬁned and should be ignored.
     Go-To Actions
     A go-to action changes the view to a speciﬁed destination (page, location, and
     magniﬁcation factor). Table 8.35 shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to
     this type of action.
                      TABLE 8.35 Additional entries speciﬁc to a go-to action
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE

                                              Specifying a go-to action in the A entry of a link annotation or outline item (see
     Tables 8.16 on page 501 and 8.4 on page 478) has the same effect as specifying the
     destination directly via the Dest entry. For example, the link annotation shown in
     Example 8.8, which uses a go-to action, has the same effect as the one in Example
     8.7 on page 502, which speciﬁes the destination directly. However, the go-to
     action is less compact and is not compatible with PDF 1.0, so using a direct desti-
     nation is preferable.

        Remote Go-To Actions
        A remote go-to action is similar to an ordinary go-to action, but jumps to a desti-
        nation in another PDF ﬁle instead of the current ﬁle. Table 8.36 shows the action
        dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of action.

        Launch Actions
        A launch action launches an application or opens or prints a document. Table
        8.37 shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of action.
        The optional Win, Mac, and Unix entries allow the action dictionary to include
        platform-speciﬁc parameters for launching the designated application. If no
        such entry is present for the given platform, the F entry is used instead. Table
        8.38 shows the platform-speciﬁc launch parameters for the Windows platform;
        those for the Mac OS and UNIX platforms are not yet deﬁned at the time of
        publication.

     Thread Actions
     A thread action jumps to a speciﬁed bead on an article thread (see Section 8.3.2,

      URI Actions
      A uniform resource identiﬁer (URI) is a string that identiﬁes (resolves to) a re-
      source on the Internet—typically a ﬁle that is the destination of a hypertext link,
      although it can also resolve to a query or other entity. A URI action causes a URI
      to be resolved. Table 8.40 shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type
      of action. (See implementation notes 74 and 75 in Appendix H.)
                         TABLE 8.40 Additional entries speciﬁc to a URI action

                                                                                                    action.

                                                                                                    solved (see below). Default value: false.
                                                                                                    This entry applies only to actions triggered by the user’s clicking an annotation; it is
                                                                                                    ignored for actions associated with outline items or with a document’s OpenAction
                                                                                                    entry.
      If the IsMap ﬂag is true and the user has triggered the URI action by clicking an
      annotation with the mouse, the coordinates of the mouse position at the time the
      action is performed should be transformed from device space to user space and
      then offset relative to the upper-left corner of the annotation rectangle (that is,
      the value of the Rect entry in the annotation with which the URI action is associ-
      ated). For example, if the mouse coordinates in user space are (xm , ym ) and the
      annotation rectangle extends from (llx , lly ) at the lower-left to (urx , ury ) at the
      upper-right, the ﬁnal coordinates (xf , yf ) are as follows:
          x f = x m – ll x
          y f = ur y – y m
     If the resulting coordinates (xf , yf ) are fractional, they should be rounded to the
     nearest integer values. They are then appended to the URI to be resolved, separat-
     ed by commas and preceded by a question mark. For example:
         http://www.adobe.com/intro?100,200
     To support URI actions, a PDF document’s catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Docu-
     ment Catalog”) may include a URI entry whose value is a URI dictionary. At the
     time of publication, only one entry is deﬁned for such a dictionary (see Table
     8.41).
                               TABLE 8.41 Entry in a URI dictionary

                                                                                                    within the document may specify URIs in partial form, to be interpreted relative to
                                                                                                    this base address. If no base URI is speciﬁed, such partial URIs will be interpreted rel-
                                                                                                    ative to the location of the document itself. The use of this entry is parallel to that of
                                                                                                    the body element <BASE>, as described in section 2.7.2 of Internet RFC 1866, Hyper-

     The Base entry allows the URI of the document itself to be recorded in situations
     in which the document may be accessed out of context. For example, if a docu-
     ment has been moved to a new location but contains relative links to other docu-
     ments that have not, the Base entry could be used to refer such links to the true
     location of the other documents, rather than that of the moved document.
     Sound Actions
     A sound action (PDF 1.2) plays a sound through the computer’s speakers. Table
     8.42 shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of action; sounds
     themselves are discussed in Section 8.7, “Sounds.”

         Movie Actions
         A movie action (PDF 1.2) can be used to play a movie in a ﬂoating window or
         within the annotation rectangle of a movie annotation (see “Movie Annotations”
         on page 510 and Section 8.8, “Movies”). The movie annotation must be asso-
         ciated with the page that is the destination of the link annotation or outline item
         containing the movie action, or with the page object with which the action is
         associated. (See implementation note 77 in Appendix H.)
         The contents of a movie action dictionary are identical to those of a movie activa-
         tion dictionary (see Table 8.80 on page 571), with the additional entries shown in
         Table 8.43. The contents of the activation dictionary associated with the movie
         annotation are ignored; the information speciﬁed in the movie action dictionary
         is used instead.

          Hide Actions
          A hide action (PDF 1.2) hides or shows one or more annotations on the screen by
          setting or clearing their Hidden ﬂags (see Section 8.4.2, “Annotation Flags”). This
          type of action can be used in combination with appearance streams and trigger
          events (Sections 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams,” and 8.5.2, “Trigger Events”) to dis-
          play pop-up help information on the screen. For example, the E (enter) and X
          (exit) trigger events in an annotation’s additional-actions dictionary can be used
          to show and hide the annotation when the user rolls the cursor in and out of its
          active area on the page; this can be used to pop up a help label, or “tool tip,”
          describing the effect of clicking the mouse at that location on the page. Table 8.44
          shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of action. (See implemen-
          tation notes 78 and 79 in Appendix H.)

      Named Actions
      Table 8.45 lists several named actions (PDF 1.2) that PDF viewer applications are
      expected to support; further names may be added in the future. (See implemen-
      tation notes 80 and 81 in Appendix H.)
                                      TABLE 8.45 Named actions
      NAME                   ACTION
      NextPage               Go to the next page of the document.
      PrevPage               Go to the previous page of the document.
      FirstPage              Go to the ﬁrst page of the document.
      LastPage               Go to the last page of the document.
      Note: Viewer applications may support additional, nonstandard named actions, but
      any document using them will not be portable. If the viewer encounters a named
      action that is inappropriate for a viewing platform, or if the viewer does not recog-
      nize the name, it should take no action.
        Table 8.46 shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to named actions.

        Form Actions
        Four additional action types (submit-form, reset-form, import-data, and
        JavaScript) are deﬁned for use with interactive forms. See Section 8.6.4, “Form
        Actions,” for details.
    8.6 Interactive Forms
        An interactive form (PDF 1.2)—sometimes referred to as an AcroForm—is a
        collection of ﬁelds for gathering information interactively from the user. A PDF
        document may contain any number of ﬁelds appearing on any combination of
        pages, all of which make up a single, global interactive form spanning the entire
        document. Arbitrary subsets of these ﬁelds can be imported or exported from the
        document; see Section 8.6.4, “Form Actions.”
        Note: Interactive forms should not be confused with form XObjects (see Section 4.9,
        “Form XObjects”). Despite the similarity of names, the two are different, unrelated
        types of object.
        Each ﬁeld in a document’s interactive form is deﬁned by a ﬁeld dictionary (see
        Section 8.6.2, “Field Dictionaries”). For purposes of deﬁnition and naming, the
        ﬁelds can be organized hierarchically and can inherit attributes from their an-
        cestors in the ﬁeld hierarchy. A ﬁeld’s children in the hierarchy may also include
        widget annotations (see “Widget Annotations” on page 511) that deﬁne its ap-
        pearance on the page; such a ﬁeld is called a terminal ﬁeld.
        As a convenience, when a ﬁeld has only a single associated widget annotation, the
        contents of the ﬁeld dictionary and the annotation dictionary (Section 8.4.1,
        “Annotation Dictionaries”) may be merged into a single dictionary containing
         entries that pertain to both a ﬁeld and an annotation. (This presents no ambigu-
         ity, since the contents of the two kinds of dictionary do not conﬂict.) If such an
         object deﬁnes an appearance stream, the appearance must be consistent with the
         object’s current value as a ﬁeld.
         Note: Fields containing text whose contents are not known in advance may need to
         construct their appearance streams dynamically instead of deﬁning them statically in
         an appearance dictionary; see “Variable Text” on page 533.
   8.6.1 Interactive Form Dictionary
         The contents and properties of a document’s interactive form are deﬁned by an
         interactive form dictionary that is referenced from the AcroForm entry in the doc-
         ument catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Catalog”). Table 8.47 shows the
         contents of this dictionary.

           ﬂag word are numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (high-order). Table 8.48 shows
           the meanings of the ﬂags; all undeﬁned ﬂag bits are reserved and must be set to 0.

                                      pushbuttons) related to signature processing without having to scan the

                                      with the “optimize” option. Merely updating the ﬁle by appending new
                                      information to the end of the previous version is safe (see Section G.6,
                                      “Updating Example”). Viewer applications can use this ﬂag to present a
                                      user requesting an optimized save with an additional alert box warning
                                      that signatures will be invalidated and requiring explicit conﬁrmation
                                      before continuing with the operation.
   8.6.2 Field Dictionaries
           Each ﬁeld in a document’s interactive form is deﬁned by a ﬁeld dictionary, which
           must be an indirect object. The ﬁeld dictionaries may be organized hierarchically
           into one or more tree structures. Many ﬁeld attributes are inheritable, meaning
           that if they are not explicitly speciﬁed for a given ﬁeld, their values are taken from
           those of its parent in the ﬁeld hierarchy. Such inheritable attributes are designat-
           ed as such in the tables below; the designation (Required; inheritable) means that
           an attribute must be deﬁned for every ﬁeld, whether explicitly in its own ﬁeld
           dictionary or by inheritance from an ancestor in the hierarchy. Table 8.49 shows
           those entries that are common to all ﬁeld dictionaries, regardless of type; those
           that pertain only to a particular type of ﬁeld are described in the relevant sections
           below.

           The value of the ﬁeld dictionary’s Ff entry is an unsigned 32-bit integer contain-
           ing ﬂags specifying various characteristics of the ﬁeld. Bit positions within the
           ﬂag word are numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (high-order). The ﬂags shown
           in Table 8.50 are common to all types of ﬁeld; ﬂags that apply only to speciﬁc
           ﬁeld types are discussed in the sections describing those types. All undeﬁned ﬂag
           bits are reserved and must be set to 0.

                                 annotations will not interact with the user; that is, they will not respond to
                                 mouse clicks or change their appearance in response to mouse motions. This
                                 ﬂag is useful for ﬁelds whose values are computed or imported from a data-
                                 base.
      2           Required       If set, the ﬁeld must have a value at the time it is exported by a submit-form
                                 action (see “Submit-Form Actions” on page 550).
      3           NoExport       If set, the ﬁeld must not be exported by a submit-form action (see “Submit-
                                 Form Actions” on page 550).
           Field Names
           The T entry in the ﬁeld dictionary (see Table 8.49 on page 531) holds a text string
           deﬁning the ﬁeld’s partial ﬁeld name. The fully qualiﬁed ﬁeld name is not explicit-
           ly deﬁned, but is constructed from the partial ﬁeld names of the ﬁeld and all of its
           ancestors. For a ﬁeld with no parent, the partial and fully qualiﬁed names are the
           same; for a ﬁeld that is the child of another ﬁeld, the fully qualiﬁed name is
formed by appending the child ﬁeld’s partial name to the parent’s fully qualiﬁed
name, separated by a period ( . ):
    parent’s_full_name.child’s_partial_name
For example, if a ﬁeld with the partial ﬁeld name PersonalData has a child whose
partial name is Address, which in turn has a child with the partial name ZipCode,
then the fully qualiﬁed name of this last ﬁeld would be
    PersonalData.Address.ZipCode
Thus all ﬁelds descended from a common ancestor will share the ancestor’s fully
qualiﬁed ﬁeld name as a common preﬁx in their own fully qualiﬁed names.
It is possible for different ﬁeld dictionaries to have the same fully qualiﬁed ﬁeld
name if they are descendants of a common ancestor with that name and have no
partial ﬁeld names (T entries) of their own. Such ﬁeld dictionaries are different
representations of the same underlying ﬁeld; they should differ only in properties
that specify their visual appearance. In particular, ﬁeld dictionaries with the same
fully qualiﬁed ﬁeld name must have the same ﬁeld type (FT), value (V), and de-
fault value (DV).
Variable Text
When the contents and properties of a ﬁeld are known in advance, its visual ap-
pearance can be speciﬁed by an appearance stream deﬁned in the PDF ﬁle itself
(see Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams,” and “Widget Annotations” on page
511). In some cases, however, the ﬁeld may contain text whose value is not
known until viewing time. Examples include text ﬁelds to be ﬁlled in with text
typed by the user from the keyboard and scrollable list boxes whose contents are
determined interactively at the time the document is displayed.
In such cases, the PDF document cannot provide a statically deﬁned appearance
stream for displaying the ﬁeld; rather, the viewer application must construct an
appearance stream dynamically at viewing time. The dictionary entries shown in
Table 8.51 provide general information about the ﬁeld’s appearance that can be
combined with the speciﬁc text it contains to construct an appearance stream.

      The new appearance stream becomes the normal appearance (N) in the appear-
      ance dictionary associated with the ﬁeld’s widget annotation (see Table 8.13 on
      page 497). (If the widget annotation has no appearance dictionary, the viewer ap-
      plication must create one and store it in the annotation dictionary’s AP entry.)
      The appearance stream—which, like all appearance streams, is a form XObject—
      has the contents of its form dictionary initialized as follows:
      • The resource dictionary (Resources) is set to the value of the ﬁeld dictionary’s
        DR entry.
      • The lower-left corner of the bounding box (BBox) is set to coordinates (0, 0) in
        the form coordinate system. The box’s top and right coordinates are taken from
        the dimensions of the annotation rectangle (the Rect entry in the widget anno-
        tation dictionary).
      • All other entries in the appearance stream’s form dictionary are set to their
        default values (see Section 4.9, “Form XObjects”).
The contents of the appearance stream are as follows:
   /Tx BMC                                               % Begin marked content with tag Tx

   EMC                                                   % End marked content
The BMC (begin marked content) and EMC (end marked content) operators are
discussed in Section 9.5, “Marked Content”; q (save graphics state) and Q (restore
graphics state) in Section 4.3.3, “Graphics State Operators”; and BT (begin text
object) and ET (end text object) in Section 5.3, “Text Objects.”
The default appearance string (DA) contains any graphics state or text state oper-
ators needed to establish the graphics state parameters, such as text size and color,
for displaying the ﬁeld’s variable text. Only operators that are allowed within text
objects may occur in this string (see Figure 4.1 on page 135). At a minimum, the
string must include a Tf (text font) operator along with its two operands, font and
size. The speciﬁed font value must match a resource name in the Font entry of the
default resource dictionary (DR). A zero value for size means that the font is to be
auto-sized: its size is computed as a function of the height of the annotation rec-
tangle.
The default appearance string should contain at most one Tm (text matrix) oper-
ator. If this operator is present, the viewer application should replace the hori-
zontal and vertical translation components with positioning values it determines
to be appropriate, based on the ﬁeld value, the quadding (Q) attribute, and any
layout rules it employs. If the default appearance string contains no Tm operator,
the viewer should insert one in the appearance stream, with appropriate horizon-
tal and vertical translation components, after the default appearance string and
before the text-positioning and text-showing operators for the variable text.
To update an existing appearance stream to reﬂect a new ﬁeld value, the viewer
application should ﬁrst copy any needed resources from the ﬁeld’s DR dictionary
into the stream’s Resources dictionary. (If the DR and Resources dictionaries con-
tain resources with the same name, the one already in the Resources dictionary
should be left intact, not replaced with the corresponding value from the DR dic-
    tionary.) The viewer application should then replace the existing contents of the
    appearance stream from
       /Tx BMC
    to the matching
       EMC
    with the corresponding new contents as shown above. (If the existing appearance
    stream contains no marked content with tag Tx, the new contents should be
    appended to the end of the original stream.)
    The optional MK entry in the ﬁeld’s widget annotation dictionary (see Table 8.28
    on page 512) can be used to provide an appearance characteristics dictionary
    (PDF 1.2) containing additional information for constructing the annotation’s
    appearance stream. Table 8.52 shows the contents of this dictionary.

   8.6.3 Field Types
         Interactive forms support the following ﬁeld types:
         • Button ﬁelds represent interactive controls on the screen that the user can
           manipulate with the mouse. They include pushbuttons, checkboxes, and radio
           buttons.
           • Text ﬁelds are boxes or spaces in which the user can enter text from the key-
             board.
           • Choice ﬁelds contain several text items, at most one of which may be selected as
             the ﬁeld value. They include scrollable list boxes and combo boxes.
           • Signature ﬁelds represent electronic “signatures” for authenticating the identity
             of a user. They can include purely mathematical authentication methods such
             as public/private-key encrypted document digests, or biometric forms of iden-
             tiﬁcation such as handwritten signatures, ﬁngerprints, or retinal scans.
           The following sections describe each of these ﬁeld types in detail. Further types
           may be added in the future.
           Button Fields
           A button ﬁeld (ﬁeld type Btn) represents an interactive control on the screen that
           the user can manipulate with the mouse. It may be any of the following:
           • A pushbutton is a purely interactive control that responds immediately to user
             input without retaining a permanent value.
           • A checkbox toggles between two states, on and off.
           • Radio buttons are a set of related toggles, at most one of which may be on at any
             given time; selecting any one of the buttons automatically deselects all the
             others.
           The various types of button ﬁeld are distinguished by ﬂags in the Ff entry, as
           shown in Table 8.53.
                              TABLE 8.53 Field ﬂags speciﬁc to button ﬁelds
BIT POSITION     NAME               MEANING
     17          Pushbutton         If set, the ﬁeld is a pushbutton that does not retain a permanent value.
     16          Radio              If set, the ﬁeld is a set of radio buttons; if clear, the ﬁeld is a checkbox. This
                                    ﬂag is meaningful only if the Pushbutton ﬂag is clear.
     15          NoToggleToOff      (Radio buttons only) If set, exactly one radio button must be selected at all
                                    times; clicking the currently selected button has no effect. If clear, clicking
                                    the selected button deselects it, leaving no button selected.
Pushbuttons
The simplest type of ﬁeld is a pushbutton ﬁeld, which has a ﬁeld type of Btn and
the Pushbutton ﬂag (see Table 8.53) set. Because this type of button retains no
permanent value, it does not use the V and DV entries in the ﬁeld dictionary (see
Table 8.49 on page 531).
Checkboxes
A checkbox ﬁeld toggles between two states, on and off, when manipulated by the
user with the mouse or keyboard. Its ﬁeld type is Btn and its Pushbutton and
Radio ﬂags (see Table 8.53) are both clear. Each state can have a separate appear-
ance, deﬁned by an appearance stream in the appearance dictionary of the ﬁeld’s
widget annotation (see Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”). The V entry in the
ﬁeld dictionary (see Table 8.49 on page 531) holds a name object representing the
checkbox’s appearance state, which is used to select the appropriate appearance
from the appearance dictionary. The appearance for the off state is optional, but
if present must be stored in the appearance dictionary under the name Off. The
recommended name for the on state is Yes, but this is not required. Example 8.9
shows a typical checkbox deﬁnition.

      Because they are limited to the Latin character set, name objects cannot be used
      to represent the values of checkbox ﬁelds in non-Latin writing systems. To ad-
      dress this problem, PDF 1.4 provides an additional, optional entry, Opt, in the
      ﬁeld dictionary for checkbox ﬁelds (see Table 8.54). When present, this entry
      holds a human-readable text string to be used in place of the V entry to denote
      the value of the ﬁeld. This allows the use of Unicode encoding to specify ﬁeld
      values using non-Latin characters.

      Radio Buttons
      A radio button ﬁeld is a set of related toggle controls, at most one of which may be
      on at any given time; selecting any one of the buttons automatically deselects all
      the others. The ﬁeld type is Btn, the Pushbutton ﬂag (see Table 8.53 on page 538)
      is clear, and the Radio ﬂag is set. This type of button ﬁeld has an additional ﬂag,
      NoToggleToOff, which speciﬁes, if set, that exactly one of the radio buttons must
      be selected at all times. In this case, clicking the currently selected button has no
      effect; if the NoToggleToOff ﬂag is clear, clicking the selected button deselects it,
      leaving no button selected.
The Kids entry in the radio button ﬁeld’s ﬁeld dictionary (see Table 8.49 on page
531) holds an array of widget annotations representing the individual buttons in
the set, each of which is a separate checkbox ﬁeld in its own right. The parent
ﬁeld’s V entry holds a name object corresponding to the appearance state of
whichever child ﬁeld is currently in the on state; the default value for this entry is
Off. Example 8.10 shows the object deﬁnitions for a set of radio buttons.

Like a checkbox ﬁeld, a radio button ﬁeld can use the optional Opt entry in the
ﬁeld dictionary (PDF 1.4) to deﬁne export values for its constituent radio buttons
using Unicode encoding for non-Latin characters (see Table 8.55). For a radio
button ﬁeld, Opt holds an array of text strings corresponding to the widget anno-
tations representing the individual radio buttons in the ﬁeld’s Kids array. The
name object in the ﬁeld’s V entry consists of a sequence of digits giving the nu-
merical position of the currently selected radio button within the Kids array, with
/0 denoting the ﬁrst button in the array. This feature can also be used to deﬁne
the same export value for multiple radio buttons, using the different computer-
generated values in the V entry to distinguish among them.

           Text Fields
           A text ﬁeld (ﬁeld type Tx) is a box or space in which the user can enter text from
           the keyboard. The text may be restricted to a single line or may be allowed to span
           multiple lines, depending on the setting of the Multiline ﬂag in the ﬁeld diction-
           ary’s Ff entry. Table 8.56 shows the ﬂags pertaining to this type of ﬁeld.
                                 TABLE 8.56 Field ﬂags speciﬁc to text ﬁelds
BIT POSITION     NAME                   MEANING
     13          Multiline              If set, the ﬁeld may contain multiple lines of text; if clear, the ﬁeld’s text
                                        is restricted to a single line.
     14          Password               If set, the ﬁeld is intended for entering a secure password that should
                                        not be echoed visibly to the screen. Characters typed from the key-
                                        board should instead be echoed in some unreadable form, such as
                                        asterisks or bullet characters.
                                        To protect password conﬁdentiality, viewer applications should never
                                        store the value of the text ﬁeld in the PDF ﬁle if this ﬂag is set.
     21          FileSelect             (PDF 1.4) If set, the text entered in the ﬁeld represents the pathname of
                                        a ﬁle whose contents are to be submitted as the value of the ﬁeld.
     23          DoNotSpellCheck        (PDF 1.4) If set, the text entered in the ﬁeld will not be spell-checked.
     24          DoNotScroll            (PDF 1.4) If set, the ﬁeld will not scroll (horizontally for single-line
                                        ﬁelds, vertically for multiple-line ﬁelds) to accommodate more text
                                        than will ﬁt within its annotation rectangle. Once the ﬁeld is full, no
                                        further text will be accepted.
       The ﬁeld’s text is held in a text string in the V (value) entry of the ﬁeld dictionary.
       The contents of this text string are used to construct an appearance stream for
       displaying the ﬁeld, as described under “Variable Text” on page 533; the text is
       presented in a single style (font, size, color, and so forth), as speciﬁed by the DA
       (default appearance) string.
       If the FileSelect ﬂag (PDF 1.4) is set, the ﬁeld functions as a ﬁle-select control. In
       this case, the ﬁeld’s text represents the pathname of a ﬁle whose contents are to be
       submitted as the ﬁeld’s value:
       • For ﬁelds submitted in HTML Form format, the submission uses the MIME
          content type multipart/form-data, as described in Internet RFC 2045, Multi-
          purpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), Part One: Format of Internet Message
          Bodies (see the Bibliography).
       • For Forms Data Format (FDF) submission, the value of the V entry in the FDF
          ﬁeld dictionary (see “FDF Fields” on page 564) is a ﬁle speciﬁcation (Section
          3.10, “File Speciﬁcations”) identifying the selected ﬁle.
       • XML format is not supported for ﬁle-select controls, so no value is submitted
          in this case.
       Besides the usual entries common to all types of ﬁeld (see Table 8.49 on page
       531), the ﬁeld dictionary for a text ﬁeld can contain the additional entry shown in
       Table 8.57.
                          TABLE 8.57 Additional entry speciﬁc to a text ﬁeld
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE

Choice Fields
A choice ﬁeld (ﬁeld type Ch) contains several text items, one or more of which
may be selected as the ﬁeld value. The items may be presented to the user in
either of two forms:
• A scrollable list box
• A combo box consisting of a drop list optionally accompanied by an editable
   text box in which the user can type a value other than the predeﬁned choices
                                 TABLE 8.58 Field ﬂags speciﬁc to choice ﬁelds
BIT POSITION     NAME                    MEANING
     18          Combo                   If set, the ﬁeld is a combo box; if clear, the ﬁeld is a list box.
     19          Edit                    If set, the combo box includes an editable text box as well as a drop list; if
                                         clear, it includes only a drop list. This ﬂag is meaningful only if the
                                         Combo ﬂag is set.
     20          Sort                    If set, the ﬁeld’s option items should be sorted alphabetically. This ﬂag is
                                         intended for use by form authoring tools, not by PDF viewer applica-
                                         tions; viewers should simply display the options in the order in which
                                         they occur in the Opt array (see Table 8.59).
     22          MultiSelect             (PDF 1.4) If set, more than one of the ﬁeld’s option items may be selected
                                         simultaneously; if clear, no more than one item at a time may be selected.
     23          DoNotSpellCheck         (PDF 1.4) If set, the text entered in the ﬁeld will not be spell-checked.
                                         This ﬂag is meaningful only if the Combo and Edit ﬂags are both set.
           The various types of choice ﬁeld are distinguished by ﬂags in the Ff entry, as
           shown in Table 8.58. Table 8.59 shows the ﬁeld dictionary entries speciﬁc to
           choice ﬁelds.

The Opt array speciﬁes the list of options to be presented to the user. Each option
is represented by a text string to be displayed on the screen as the name of the
option. The corresponding element of the Opt array may contain either this text
string by itself or a two-element array with the text string as its ﬁrst element. In
the latter case, the second element of the array is a default appearance string to be
used in constructing a dynamic appearance stream, as described under “Variable
Text” on page 533.
The ﬁeld dictionary’s V (value) entry (see Table 8.49 on page 531) identiﬁes the
item or items currently selected in the choice ﬁeld. If the ﬁeld does not allow
multiple selection—that is, if the MultiSelect ﬂag (PDF 1.4) is not set—or if mul-
tiple selection is supported but only one item is currently selected, V is a text
string representing the name of the selected item, as given in the ﬁeld dictionary’s
Opt array; if multiple items are selected, it is an array of such strings. (For items
represented in the Opt array by a two-element array, the name string is the ﬁrst of
the two array elements.) The default value of V is null, indicating that no item is
currently selected.
Example 8.12 shows a typical choice ﬁeld deﬁnition.

Signature Fields
A signature ﬁeld (PDF 1.3) represents an electronic “signature” for authenticating
the identity of a user. The signature may be purely mathematical, such as a
public/private-key encrypted document digest, or it may be a biometric form of
identiﬁcation such as a handwritten signature, ﬁngerprint, or retinal scan. The
speciﬁc form of authentication used is implemented by a plug-in signature
handler. Third-party handler writers are encouraged to register their handler
names with Adobe; see Appendix E.
Note: The speciﬁcation for public-key digital signature authentication is available in
the Adobe document PDF Public-Key Digital Signature and Encryption Speciﬁca-
tion (see the Bibliography).
The ﬁeld dictionary representing a signature ﬁeld contains the standard entries
described in Table 8.49 on page 531. The ﬁeld type (FT) is Sig, the ﬁeld value (V)
is a signature dictionary specifying various attributes of the signature ﬁeld, and
the default value (DV) is a signature dictionary containing default values for
reinitializing the contents of the V dictionary in response to a reset-form action
(see “Reset-Form Actions” on page 554). Filling in (“signing”) the signature ﬁeld
entails updating at least the V entry, and usually also the AP entry of the associ-
ated widget annotation. Exporting a signature ﬁeld typically exports the T, V, and
AP entries.
Table 8.60 shows the contents of the signature dictionary. Signature handlers are
free to use or omit those entries that are marked optional in the table, but are en-
couraged to use them in a standard way if they are used at all. In addition, speciﬁc
signature handlers may add private entries of their own. To avoid name duplica-
tion, it is suggested that the keys for all such private entries be preﬁxed with the
registered handler name followed by a period ( . ).
The DV (default value) entry in the ﬁeld dictionary may specify a signature dic-
tionary for an unsigned ﬁeld that is preloaded with default values for some
entries. Signature handlers are free to use or ignore these values in initializing the
V dictionary for a signed ﬁeld. The default dictionary may include default values
for private entries belonging to multiple handlers; a given handler should use
only those entries that are pertinent to itself and strip out the others.
Like any other ﬁeld, a signature ﬁeld may actually be described by a widget anno-
tation dictionary containing entries pertaining to an annotation as well as a ﬁeld
(see “Widget Annotations” on page 511). The annotation rectangle (Rect) in such
a dictionary gives the position of the ﬁeld on its page. For signature ﬁelds (such as
PPK signatures) that are not intended to be visible, the annotation rectangle may
have zero height and width.

          The appearance dictionary (AP) of a signature ﬁeld’s widget annotation deﬁnes
          the ﬁeld’s visual appearance on the page (see Section 8.4.4, “Appearance
          Streams”). For a signature ﬁeld that has not been ﬁlled in, the normal appearance
          is usually blank. If no plug-in signature handler is available for a given signing
          method, the normal appearance for a signature that has been ﬁlled in should
          simply show an appropriate representation of the signature: text, ink strokes rep-
          resenting a handwritten signature, a bitmap of a ﬁngerprint, or any other repre-
          sentation appropriate for the particular signing method. If an appropriate
          signature handler is available, three appearances are possible:
          • The unvalidated appearance represents a signature that has not yet been vali-
             dated by the signature handler.
          • The valid appearance represents a signature that has been validated and ac-
             cepted by the signature handler.
      • The invalid appearance represents a signature that has been validated and
        rejected by the signature handler.
      When the signature handler is invoked to validate the signature, it should alter
      the signature’s appearance from unvalidated to either valid or invalid. It is sug-
      gested that the unvalidated appearance contain an overprinted yellow question
      mark, the invalid appearance an overprinted red X, and the valid appearance the
      logo of the signature handler underprinted as a watermark.
8.6.4 Form Actions
      Interactive forms support four special types of action in addition to those de-
      scribed in Section 8.5.3, “Action Types”:
      • Submit-form actions transmit the names and values of selected interactive form
        ﬁelds to a speciﬁed uniform resource locator (URL), presumably the address of
        a World Wide Web server that will process them and send back a response.
      • Reset-form actions reset selected interactive form ﬁelds to their default values.
      • Import-data actions import Forms Data Format (FDF) data into the docu-
        ment’s interactive form from a speciﬁed ﬁle.
      • JavaScript actions (PDF 1.3) cause a script to be compiled and executed by the
        JavaScript interpreter.
      Submit-Form Actions
      A submit-form action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form
      ﬁelds to a speciﬁed uniform resource locator (URL), presumably the address of a
      World Wide Web server that will process them and send back a response. Table
      8.61 shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of action.
      The value of the action dictionary’s Flags entry is an unsigned 32-bit integer con-
      taining ﬂags specifying various characteristics of the action. Bit positions within
      the ﬂag word are numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (high-order). Table 8.62
      shows the meanings of the ﬂags; all undeﬁned ﬂag bits are reserved and must be
      set to 0.

       1     Include/Exclude           If clear, the Fields array (see Table 8.61) speciﬁes which ﬁelds to
                                       include in the submission. (All descendants of the speciﬁed ﬁelds in
                                       the ﬁeld hierarchy are submitted as well.) If set, the Fields array tells
                                       which ﬁelds to exclude; all ﬁelds in the document’s interactive form
                                       are submitted except those listed in the Fields array and those whose
                                       NoExport ﬂag (see Table 8.50 on page 532) is set.
       2     IncludeNoValueFields      If set, all ﬁelds designated by the Fields array and the Include/
                                       Exclude ﬂag are submitted, regardless of whether they have a value
                                       (V entry in the ﬁeld dictionary); for ﬁelds without a value, only the
                                       ﬁeld name is transmitted. If clear, ﬁelds without a value are not sub-
                                       mitted.
3 ExportFormat       If set, ﬁeld names and values are submitted in HTML Form format.
                     If clear, they are submitted in Forms Data Format (FDF); see Sec-
                     tion 8.6.6, “Forms Data Format.” This ﬂag is meaningful only when
                     the XML ﬂag is clear; if XML is set, this ﬂag is ignored.
4 GetMethod          If set, ﬁeld names and values are submitted using an HTTP GET
                     request; if clear, they are submitted using a POST request. This ﬂag
                     is meaningful only when the ExportFormat ﬂag is set; if Export-
                     Format is clear, this ﬂag must also be clear.
5 SubmitCoordinates  If set, the coordinates of the mouse click that caused the submit-
                     form action are transmitted as part of the form data. The coordi-
                     nate values are relative to the upper-left corner of the ﬁeld’s widget
                     annotation rectangle. They are represented in the data in the format
                         name.x=xval&name.y=yval
                     where name is the ﬁeld’s mapping name (TM in the ﬁeld dictionary)
                     if present, otherwise the ﬁeld name. If the value of the TM entry is a
                     single space character, both the name and the dot following it are
                     suppressed, resulting in the format
                         x=xval&y=yval
                     This ﬂag is meaningful only when the ExportFormat ﬂag is set; if
                     ExportFormat is clear, this ﬂag must also be clear.
6 XML                (PDF 1.4) If set, ﬁeld names and values are submitted in XML for-
                     mat; if clear, they are submitted in HTML Form format or Forms
                     Data Format (FDF), according to the value of the ExportFormat
                     ﬂag.

                     contents of all incremental updates to the underlying PDF docu-
                     ment, as contained in the Differences entry in the FDF dictionary
                     (see Table 8.69 on page 561); if clear, the incremental updates are
                     not included.
8 IncludeAnnotations (PDF 1.4) Meaningful only when the form is being submitted in
                     Forms Data Format (that is, when both the XML and Export-

                     annotations in the underlying PDF document; if clear, the annota-
                     tions are not included.

                                     Format of Internet Message Bodies; see the Bibliography). If this ﬂag
                                     is set, all other ﬂags are ignored except GetMethod.
10       CanonicalFormat             (PDF 1.4) If set, any submitted ﬁeld values representing dates are
                                     converted to the standard format described in Section 3.8.2,
                                     “Dates.” (The interpretation of a form ﬁeld as a date is not speciﬁed
                                     explicitly in the ﬁeld itself, but only in the JavaScript code that pro-
                                     cesses it.)

                                     Format ﬂags are clear) and the IncludeAnnotations ﬂag is set. If set,
                                     will include only those annotations whose T entry matches the
                                     name of the current user, as determined by the remote server to
                                     which the form is being submitted. (The T entry, which speciﬁes the
                                     text label to be displayed in the title bar of the annotation’s pop-up
                                     window, is assumed to represent the name of the user authoring the
                                     annotation.) This allows multiple users to collaborate in annotating
                                     a single remote PDF document without affecting one another’s
                                     annotations.

                                     Format ﬂags are clear). If set, the submitted FDF will exclude the F
                                     entry.
   The set of ﬁelds whose names and values are to be submitted is deﬁned by the
   Fields array in the action dictionary (Table 8.61) together with the Include/
   Exclude and IncludeNoValueFields ﬂags in the Flags entry (Table 8.62). Each ele-
   ment of the Fields array identiﬁes an interactive form ﬁeld, either by an indirect
   reference to its ﬁeld dictionary or (PDF 1.3) by its fully qualiﬁed ﬁeld name (see
   “Field Names” on page 532). If the Include/Exclude ﬂag is clear, the submission
   consists of all ﬁelds listed in the Fields array, along with any descendants of those
   ﬁelds in the ﬁeld hierarchy. If the Include/Exclude ﬂag is set, the submission con-
   sists of all ﬁelds in the document’s interactive form except those listed in the
   Fields array.
Note: The NoExport ﬂag in the ﬁeld dictionary’s Ff entry (see Tables 8.49 on page
531 and 8.50 on page 532) takes precedence over the action’s Fields array and
Include/Exclude ﬂag. Fields whose NoExport ﬂag is set are never included in a
submit-form action.
Field names and values may be submitted in any of three formats—HTML Form
format, XML, or Forms Data Format (FDF)—depending on the settings of the
action’s ExportFormat and XML ﬂags. (The ﬁrst two formats are described,
respectively, in Internet RFC 1866, Hypertext Markup Language 2.0 Proposed
Standard, and in the World Wide Web Consortium document Extensible Markup
Language (XML) 1.0; see the Bibliography. FDF is described in Section 8.6.6,
“Forms Data Format”; see also implementation note 86 in Appendix H.) The
name submitted for each ﬁeld is its fully qualiﬁed name (see “Field Names” on
page 532), and the value is that speciﬁed by the V entry in its ﬁeld dictionary.
Note: For pushbutton ﬁelds submitted in FDF, the value submitted is that of the AP
entry in the ﬁeld’s widget annotation dictionary. If the submit-form action diction-
ary contains no Fields entry, such pushbutton ﬁelds are not submitted at all.
Fields with no value (that is, whose ﬁeld dictionary does not contain a V entry)
are ordinarily not included in the submission. The submit-form action’s Include-
NoValueFields ﬂag overrides this behavior; if this ﬂag is set, such valueless ﬁelds
are included in the submission by name only, with no associated value.
Reset-Form Actions
A reset-form action resets selected interactive form ﬁelds to their default values;
that is, it sets the value of the V entry in the ﬁeld dictionary to that of the DV entry
(see Table 8.49 on page 531). If no default value is deﬁned for a ﬁeld, its V entry is
removed. For ﬁelds that can have no value (such as pushbuttons), the action has
no effect. Table 8.63 shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of
action.
The value of the action dictionary’s Flags entry is an unsigned 32-bit integer con-
taining ﬂags specifying various characteristics of the action. Bit positions within
the ﬂag word are numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (high-order). At the time of
publication, only one ﬂag is deﬁned for this type of action; Table 8.64 shows its
meaning. All undeﬁned ﬂag bits are reserved and must be set to 0.

           An import-data action imports Forms Data Format (FDF) data into the docu-
           ment’s interactive form from a speciﬁed ﬁle (see Section 8.6.6, “Forms Data For-
           mat”). Table 8.65 shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of

      JavaScript Actions
      A JavaScript action (PDF 1.3) causes a script to be compiled and executed by the
      JavaScript interpreter. Depending on the nature of the script, this can cause vari-
      ous interactive form ﬁelds in the document to update their values or change their
      visual appearances. Netscape Communications Corporation’s Client-Side Java-
      Script Reference and Adobe Technical Note #5186, Acrobat Forms JavaScript
      Object Speciﬁcation (see the Bibliography) give details on the contents and effects
      of JavaScript scripts. Table 8.66 shows the action dictionary entries speciﬁc to this
      type of action.

                                                                                                    mentation note 89 in Appendix H.)
      To support the use of parameterized function calls in JavaScript scripts, the
      JavaScript entry in a PDF document’s name dictionary (see Section 3.6.3, “Name
      Dictionary”) can contain a name tree mapping name strings to document-level
      JavaScript actions. When the document is opened, all of the actions in this name
      tree are executed, deﬁning JavaScript functions for use by other scripts in the
      document.
      Note: The name strings associated with individual JavaScript actions in the name
      dictionary serve merely as a convenient means for organizing and packaging scripts.
      The names are arbitrary and need not bear any relation to the JavaScript name
      space itself.
8.6.5 Named Pages
      The optional Pages entry (PDF 1.3) in a document’s name dictionary (see Sec-
      tion 3.6.3, “Name Dictionary”) contains a name tree that maps name strings to
      individual pages within the document. Naming a page allows it to be referenced
      in two different ways:
      • An import-data action can add the named page to the document into which
         FDF is being imported, either as a page or as a button appearance.
      • A script executed by a JavaScript action can add the named page to the current
         document as a regular page.
      A named page that is to be visible to the user should be left in the page tree (see
      Section 3.6.2, “Page Tree”), with a reference to it in the appropriate leaf node of
      the name dictionary’s Pages tree. If the page is not to be displayed by the viewer
      application, it should be referenced from the name dictionary’s Templates tree
      instead. Such invisible pages should have an object type of Template rather than
      Page, and should have no Parent or B entry (see Table 3.18 on page 88). Regard-
      less of whether the page is named in the Pages or Templates tree or whether it is
      added to a document by an import-data or JavaScript action, the new copy is not
      itself named.
8.6.6 Forms Data Format
      This section describes Forms Data Format (FDF), the ﬁle format used for inter-
      active form data (PDF 1.2). FDF is used when submitting form data to a server,
      receiving the response, and incorporating it into the interactive form. It can also
      be used to export form data to stand-alone ﬁles that can be stored, transmitted
      electronically, and imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.
      In addition, beginning in PDF 1.3, it can be used to deﬁne a container for anno-
      tations that are separate from the PDF document to which they apply.
FDF is based on PDF; it uses the same syntax (see Section 3.1, “Lexical Conven-
tions”) and basic object types (Section 3.2, “Objects”), and has essentially the
same ﬁle structure (Section 3.4, “File Structure”). However, it differs from PDF in
the following ways:
• The cross-reference table (Section 3.4.3, “Cross-Reference Table”) is optional.
• FDF ﬁles cannot be updated (see Section 3.4.5, “Incremental Updates”); objects
   can only be of generation 0, and no two objects can have the same object num-
   ber.
• The document structure is much simpler than PDF, since the body of an FDF
   document consists of only one required object.
• The length of a stream may not be speciﬁed by an indirect object.
FDF uses the MIME content type application/vnd.fdf. On the Windows and
UNIX platforms, FDF ﬁles have the extension .fdf; on Mac OS, they have ﬁle type
'FDF '.
FDF File Structure
An FDF ﬁle is structured in essentially the same way as a PDF ﬁle, but need con-
tain only those elements required for the export and import of interactive form
and annotation data. It consists of three required elements and one optional one
(see Figure 8.6):
• A one-line header identifying the version number of the PDF speciﬁcation to
   which the ﬁle conforms
• A body containing the objects that make up the content of the ﬁle
• An optional cross-reference table containing information about the objects in
   the ﬁle
• A trailer giving the location of various objects within the body of the ﬁle
                                        Header

                           FIGURE 8.6 FDF ﬁle structure
FDF Header
The ﬁrst line of an FDF ﬁle is a header, originally intended to identify the version
of the PDF speciﬁcation to which the ﬁle conforms. However, for historical rea-
sons, this version number is now frozen and must read
   %FDF−1.2
The true version number is now given by the Version entry in the FDF catalog
dictionary (see “FDF Catalog,” below; see also implementation note 90 in Appen-
dix H).
FDF Body
The body of an FDF ﬁle consists of a sequence of indirect objects representing the
ﬁle’s catalog (see “FDF Catalog” on page 560), together with any additional
objects that the catalog may reference. The objects are of the same basic types
     described in Section 3.2, “Objects.” Just as in PDF, objects in FDF can be direct or
     indirect.
     FDF Trailer
     The trailer of an FDF ﬁle enables an application reading the ﬁle to ﬁnd signiﬁcant
     objects quickly within the body of the ﬁle. The last line of the ﬁle contains only
     the end-of-ﬁle marker, %%EOF. This is preceded by the FDF trailer dictionary,
     consisting of the keyword trailer followed by a series of one or more key-value
     pairs enclosed in double angle brackets (<< … >>). The only required key is Root,
     whose value is an indirect reference to the ﬁle’s catalog dictionary (see Table
     8.67). The trailer may optionally contain additional entries for objects that are
     referenced from within the catalog.
                          TABLE 8.67 Entry in the FDF trailer dictionary
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE
Root                                    dictionary                                                  (Required; must be an indirect reference) The catalog object for this FDF ﬁle (see
                                                                                                    “FDF Catalog,” below).
     Thus the trailer has the following overall structure:
        trailer
            << Root c 0 R
                key2 value2
                …
                keyn valuen
            >>
        %%EOF
     where c is the object number of the ﬁle’s catalog dictionary.
     FDF Catalog
     The root node of an FDF ﬁle’s object hierarchy is the catalog dictionary, located
     via the Root entry in the ﬁle’s trailer dictionary (see “FDF Trailer,” above). As
     shown in Table 8.68, the only required entry in the catalog is FDF; its value is an
     FDF dictionary (Table 8.69), which in turn contains references to other objects
        describing the ﬁle’s contents. The catalog may also contain an optional Version
        entry identifying the version of the PDF speciﬁcation to which this FDF ﬁle con-
        forms.

           Embedded FDF ﬁles speciﬁed in the FDF dictionary’s EmbeddedFDFs entry may
           optionally be encrypted. Besides the usual entries for an embedded ﬁle stream,
           the stream dictionary representing such an encrypted FDF ﬁle must contain the
          additional entry shown in Table 8.70 to identify the revision number of the FDF
          encryption algorithm used to encrypt the ﬁle. Although the FDF encryption
          mechanism is separate from the one for PDF ﬁle encryption described in Section
          3.5, “Encryption,” revision 1 (the only one deﬁned at the time of publication)
          uses a similar RC4 encryption algorithm based on a 40-bit encryption key. The
          key is computed via an MD5 hash, using a padded user-supplied password as
          input. The computation is identical to steps 1 and 2 of Algorithm 3.2 on page 78;
          the ﬁrst 5 bytes of the result are the encryption key for the embedded FDF ﬁle.

          The JavaScript entry in the FDF dictionary holds a JavaScript dictionary contain-
          ing JavaScript scripts that are deﬁned globally at the document level, rather than
          associated with individual ﬁelds. The dictionary can contain scripts deﬁning
          JavaScript functions for use by other scripts in the document, as well as scripts to
          be executed immediately before and after the FDF ﬁle is imported. Table 8.71
          shows the contents of this dictionary.

      FDF Fields
      Each ﬁeld in an FDF ﬁle is described by an FDF ﬁeld dictionary. Table 8.72 shows
      the contents of this type of dictionary. Most of the entries have the same form
      and meaning as the corresponding entries in a ﬁeld dictionary (Tables 8.49 on
      page 531, 8.51 on page 534, 8.57 on page 544, and 8.59 on page 546) or a widget
      annotation dictionary (Tables 8.10 on page 490 and 8.28 on page 512). Unless
      otherwise indicated in the table, importing a ﬁeld causes the values of the entries
      in the FDF ﬁeld dictionary to replace those of the corresponding entries in the
      ﬁeld with the same fully qualiﬁed name in the target document. (See implemen-
      tation notes 93–98 in Appendix H.)

          An FDF template dictionary contains information describing a named page that
          serves as a template. Table 8.75 shows the contents of this type of dictionary.

                                                                                                    renamed in the event of name conﬂicts with existing ﬁelds; see below for further
                                                                                                    discussion. Default value: true.
          The names of ﬁelds imported from a template may sometimes conﬂict with those
          of existing ﬁelds in the target document. This can occur, for example, if the same
          template page is imported more than once or if two different templates have
          ﬁelds with the same names. If the Rename ﬂag in the FDF template dictionary is
          true, ﬁelds with such conﬂicting names are renamed to guarantee their unique-
          ness. If Rename is false, the ﬁelds are not renamed; this results in multiple ﬁelds
          with the same name in the target document. Each time the FDF ﬁle provides
          attributes for a given ﬁeld name, all ﬁelds with that name will be updated. (See
          implementation notes 99 and 100 in Appendix H.)
        The TRef entry in an FDF template dictionary holds a named page reference
        dictionary describing the location of external templates or page elements. Table
        8.76 shows the contents of this type of dictionary.

        FDF Annotation Dictionaries
        Each annotation dictionary in an FDF ﬁle must have a Page entry (see Table
        8.77) indicating the page of the source document to which the annotation is
        attached.
                  TABLE 8.77 Additional entry for annotation dictionaries in an FDF ﬁle
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE

                                                                                                    this annotation should appear, where page 0 is the ﬁrst page.
    8.7 Sounds
        A sound object (PDF 1.2) is a stream containing sample values that deﬁne a sound
        to be played through the computer’s speakers. The Sound entry in a sound anno-
        tation or sound action dictionary (see Tables 8.26 on page 510 and 8.42 on page
        525) identiﬁes a sound object representing the sound to be played when the
        annotation is activated.
        Since a sound object is a stream, it can contain any of the standard entries com-
        mon to all streams, as described in Table 3.4 on page 38. In particular, if it con-
        tains an F (ﬁle speciﬁcation) entry, then the sound is deﬁned in an external ﬁle.
     This must be a self-describing sound ﬁle, containing all information needed to
     render the sound; no additional information need be present in the PDF ﬁle.
     Note: The AIFF, AIFF-C (Mac OS), RIFF (.wav), and snd (.au) ﬁle formats are all
     self-describing.
     If no F entry is present, the sound object itself contains the sample data and all
     other information needed to deﬁne the sound. Table 8.78 shows the additional
     dictionary entries speciﬁc to a sound object.

    Sample values are stored in the stream with the most signiﬁcant bits ﬁrst (“big-
    endian” order for samples larger than 8 bits). Samples that are not a multiple of 8
    bits are packed into consecutive bytes, starting at the most signiﬁcant end. If a
    sample extends across a byte boundary, the most signiﬁcant bits are placed in the
    ﬁrst byte, followed by less signiﬁcant bits in subsequent bytes. For dual-channel
    stereophonic sounds, the samples are stored in an interleaved format, with each
    sample value for the left channel (channel 1) preceding the corresponding sample
    for the right (channel 2).
    To maximize the portability of PDF documents containing embedded sounds,
    Adobe recommends that PDF viewer applications and plug-in extensions sup-
    port at least the following formats (assuming the platform has sufﬁcient hard-
    ware and OS support to play sounds at all):
        R        8000, 11,025, or 22,050 samples per second
        C        1 or 2 channels
        B        8 or 16 bits per channel
        E        Raw, Signed, or muLaw encoding
    If the encoding (E) is Raw or Signed, then R must be 11,025 or 22,050 samples per
    channel. If the encoding is muLaw, then R must be 8000 samples per channel, C
    must be 1 channel, and B must be 8 bits per channel. Sound players should be
    prepared to convert between formats, downsample rates, and combine channels
    as necessary to render sound on the target platform.
8.8 Movies
    PDF includes the ability to embed movies within a document by means of movie
    annotations (see “Movie Annotations” on page 510). Despite the name, a movie
    may consist entirely of sound with no visible images to be displayed on the
    screen. The Movie and A (activation) entries in the movie annotation dictionary
    refer, respectively, to a movie dictionary (Table 8.79) describing the static charac-
    teristics of the movie and a movie activation dictionary (Table 8.80) specifying
    how it should be presented.

            9Document Interchange
THE FEATURES DESCRIBED in this chapter do not affect the ﬁnal appearance
of a document. Rather, they allow it to include higher-level information that is
useful for the interchange of documents among applications. They include:
• Procedure sets (Section 9.1) that deﬁne the implementation of PDF operators
• Metadata (Section 9.2) consisting of general information about a document or
  a component of a document, such as its title, author, and creation and modiﬁ-
  cation dates
• File identiﬁers (Section 9.3) for reliable reference from one PDF ﬁle to another
• Page-piece dictionaries (Section 9.4) allowing an application to embed private
  data in a PDF document for its own use
• Marked-content operators (Section 9.5) for identifying portions of a content
  stream and associating them with additional properties or externally speciﬁed
  objects
• Logical structure facilities (Section 9.6) for imposing a hierarchical organization
  on the content of a document
• Tagged PDF (Section 9.7), a set of conventions for using the marked content
  and logical structure facilities to facilitate the extraction and reuse of a docu-
  ment’s content for other purposes
• Various ways of increasing the accessibility of a document to disabled users
  (Section 9.8), including the identiﬁcation of the natural language in which it is
  written (such as English or Spanish) for the beneﬁt of a text-to-speech engine
• The Web Capture plug-in extension (Section 9.9), which creates PDF ﬁles from
  Internet-based or locally resident HTML, PDF, GIF, JPEG, and ASCII text ﬁles
                                           573
    • Facilities supporting prepress production workﬂows (Section 9.10), such as the
       speciﬁcation of page boundaries and the generation of printer’s marks, color
       separations, output intents, traps, and low-resolution proxies for high-resolution
       images
9.1 Procedure Sets
    The PDF operators used in content streams are grouped into categories of related
    operators called procedure sets (see Table 9.1). Each procedure set corresponds to
    a named resource containing the implementations of the operators in that pro-
    cedure set. The ProcSet entry in a content stream’s resource dictionary (see Sec-
    tion 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries”) holds an array consisting of the names of the
    procedure sets used in that content stream. These procedure sets are used only
    when the content stream is printed to a PostScript output device; the names
    identify PostScript procedure sets that must be sent to the device to interpret the
    PDF operators in the content stream. Each element of this array must be one of
    the predeﬁned names shown in Table 9.1. (See implementation note 102 in
    Appendix H.)
                             TABLE 9.1 Predeﬁned procedure sets
    NAME                  CATEGORY OF OPERATORS
    PDF                   Painting and graphics state
    Text                  Text
    ImageB                Grayscale images or image masks
    ImageC                Color images
    ImageI                Indexed (color-table) images
    Note: Beginning with PDF 1.4, this feature is considered obsolete. For compatibility
    with existing viewer applications, PDF producer applications should continue to
    specify procedure sets (preferably all of those listed in Table 9.1, unless it is known
    that fewer are needed). However, viewer applications should not depend on the cor-
    rectness of this information.
 9.2 Metadata
      A PDF document may include general information such as the document’s title,
      author, and creation and modiﬁcation dates. Such global information about the
      document itself (as opposed to its content or structure) is called metadata, and is
      intended to assist in cataloguing and searching for documents in external data-
      bases. A document’s metadata may also be added or changed by users or plug-in
      extensions (see implementation note 103 in Appendix H). Beginning with PDF
      1.4, metadata can also be speciﬁed for individual components of a document.
      Metadata can be stored in a PDF document in either of the following ways:
      • In a document information dictionary associated with the document (Section
        9.2.1)
      • In a metadata steam (PDF 1.4) associated with the document or a component
        of the document (Section 9.2.2)
9.2.1 Document Information Dictionary
      The optional Info entry in the trailer of a PDF ﬁle (see Section 3.4.4, “File Trailer”)
      can hold a document information dictionary containing metadata for the docu-
      ment; Table 9.2 shows its contents. Any entry whose value is not known should be
      omitted from the dictionary, rather than included with an empty string as its
      value.
      Some plug-in extensions may choose to permit searches on the contents of the
      document information dictionary. To facilitate browsing and editing, all keys in
      the dictionary are fully spelled out, not abbreviated. New keys should be chosen
      with care so that they make sense to users.
      Note: Although viewer applications can store custom metadata in the document
      information dictionary, it is inappropriate to store private content or structural in-
      formation there; such information should be stored in the document catalog instead
      (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Catalog”).

9.2.2 Metadata Streams
      Metadata, both for an entire document and for components within a document,
      can be stored in PDF streams called metadata streams (PDF 1.4). The advantages
      of metadata streams over the document information dictionary include the fol-
      lowing:
      • PDF-based workﬂows often embed metadata-bearing artwork as components
        within larger documents. Metadata streams provide a standard way of pre-
        serving the metadata of these components for examination downstream. PDF-
        aware applications should be able to derive a list of all metadata-bearing
        document components from the PDF document itself.
      • PDF documents are often made available on the World Wide Web or in other
        environments, where many tools routinely examine, catalog, and classify docu-
        ments. These tools should be able to understand the self-contained description
        of the document even if they do not understand PDF.
      Besides the usual entries common to all stream dictionaries (see Table 3.4 on
      page 38), the metadata stream dictionary contains the additional entries listed in
      Table 9.3.
      The contents of a metadata stream is the metadata represented in Extensible
      Markup Language (XML). This information will be visible as plain text to tools
      that are not PDF-aware only if the metadata stream is both unﬁltered and unen-
      crypted.

         The format of the XML representing the metadata is deﬁned as part of a frame-
         work called the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP™) and described in the
         Adobe document XMP: Extensible Metadata Platform (see the Bibliography).
         This framework provides a way to use XML to represent metadata describing
         documents and their components, and is intended to be adopted by a wider class
         of applications than just those that process PDF. It includes a method to embed
         XML data within non-XML data ﬁles in a platform-independent format that can
         be easily located and accessed by simple scanning rather than requiring the docu-
         ment ﬁle to be parsed.
         A metadata stream can be attached to a document through the Metadata entry in
         the document catalog (see Chapter 3.6.1, “Document Catalog,” and also see
         implementation note 104 in Appendix H). In addition, most PDF document
         components represented as a stream or dictionary can have a Metadata entry (see
         Table 9.4).
                      TABLE 9.4 Additional entry for components having metadata
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE

         In general, a PDF stream or dictionary can have metadata attached to it as long as
         the stream or dictionary represents an actual information resource, as opposed to
         serving as an implementation artifact. Table 9.5 lists the PDF constructs that are
         considered implementational (and hence cannot have associated metadata), and
         indicates where further information about each one can be found.

    For the remaining PDF constructs, there is sometimes ambiguity about exactly
    which stream or dictionary should bear the Metadata entry. Such cases are to be
    resolved so that the metadata is attached as close as possible to the object that
    actually stores the data resource described. For example, metadata describing a
    tiling pattern should be attached to the pattern stream’s dictionary, but a shading
    should have metadata attached to the shading dictionary itself, rather than to the
    shading pattern dictionary that refers to it. Similarly, metadata describing an
    ICCBased color space should be attached to the ICC proﬁle stream describing it,
    and metadata for fonts should be attached to font ﬁle streams rather than to font
    dictionaries.
    In tables describing document components in this book, the Metadata entry is
    listed only for those in which it is most likely to be used; keep in mind, however,
    that this entry may appear in any component represented as a stream or diction-
    ary except those listed in Table 9.5.
    In addition, metadata can also be associated with marked content within a con-
    tent stream. This association is created by including an entry in the property list
    dictionary whose key is Metadata and whose value is the metadata stream dic-
    tionary. Because this construct refers to an object outside the content stream, the
    property list must be referred to indirectly as a named resource (see Section 9.5.1,
    “Property Lists”).
9.3 File Identiﬁers
    PDF ﬁles may contain references to other PDF ﬁles (see Section 3.10, “File Speciﬁ-
    cations”). Simply storing a ﬁle name, however, even in a platform-independent
    format, does not guarantee that the ﬁle can be found. Even if the ﬁle still exists
    and its name has not been changed, different server software applications may
    identify it in different ways. For example, servers running on DOS platforms must
    convert all ﬁle names to 8 characters and a 3-character extension; different serv-
    ers may use different strategies for converting longer ﬁle names to this format.
    External ﬁle references can be made more reliable by including a ﬁle identiﬁer
    (PDF 1.1) in the ﬁle itself and using it in addition to the normal platform-based
    ﬁle designation. Matching the identiﬁer in the ﬁle reference with the one in the
    ﬁle itself conﬁrms whether the desired ﬁle was found.
    File identiﬁers are deﬁned by the optional ID entry in a PDF ﬁle’s trailer dic-
    tionary (see Section 3.4.4, “File Trailer”; see also implementation note 105 in
    Appendix H). The value of this entry is an array of two strings. The ﬁrst string is
    a permanent identiﬁer based on the contents of the ﬁle at the time it was original-
    ly created, and does not change when the ﬁle is incrementally updated. The sec-
    ond string is a changing identiﬁer based on the ﬁle’s contents at the time it was
    last updated. When a ﬁle is ﬁrst written, both identiﬁers are set to the same value.
    If both identiﬁers match when a ﬁle reference is resolved, it is very likely that the
    correct ﬁle has been found; if only the ﬁrst identiﬁer matches, then a different
    version of the correct ﬁle has been found.
    To help ensure the uniqueness of ﬁle identiﬁers, it is recommend that they be
    computed using a message digest algorithm such as MD5 (described in Internet
    RFC 1321, The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm; see the Bibliography), using the
    following information (see implementation note 106 in Appendix H):
    •  The current time
    •  A string representation of the ﬁle’s location, usually a pathname
    •  The size of the ﬁle in bytes
    •  The values of all entries in the ﬁle’s document information dictionary (see
       Section 9.2.1, “Document Information Dictionary”)
9.4 Page-Piece Dictionaries
    The optional PieceInfo entry in a page object or a form dictionary (see Tables
    3.18 on page 88 and 4.41 on page 284) can hold a page-piece dictionary (PDF 1.3)
    containing private application data associated with a PDF page or a form
    XObject. Applications can use this dictionary as a place to store any private data
    they wish in connection with that page or form. Such private data can convey
    information meaningful to the application that produces it (such as informa-
    tion on object grouping for a graphics editor or the layer information used by
    Adobe Photoshop®), but is typically ignored by general-purpose PDF viewer
    applications.
    As Table 9.6 shows, a page-piece dictionary may contain any number of entries,
    each keyed by the name of a distinct application or of a “well-known” data type
    recognized by a family of applications. The value associated with each key is an
    application data dictionary containing the private data to be used by the applica-
            tion. The Private entry may have a value of any data type, but typically it will be a
            dictionary containing all of the private data needed by the application other than
            the actual content of the page or form.

                                                                                                    in the form of a dictionary.
            The LastModiﬁed entry indicates when this application last altered the content of
            the page or form. If the page-piece dictionary contains several application data
            dictionaries, their modiﬁcation dates can be compared with those in the corre-
            sponding entry of the page object or form dictionary (see Tables 3.18 on page 88
            and 4.41 on page 284) to ascertain which application data dictionary corresponds
            to the current content of the page or form. Because some platforms may use only
            an approximate value for the date and time or may not deal correctly with dif-
            fering time zones, modiﬁcation dates are compared only for equality and not for
            sequential ordering.
            Note: It is possible for two or more application data dictionaries to have the same
            modiﬁcation date. Applications can use this capability to deﬁne multiple or extended
            versions of the same data format. For example, suppose that earlier versions of an
            application use an application data dictionary named PictureEdit, while later ver-
            sions of the same application extend the data to include additional items not previ-
            ously used. The original data could continue to be kept in the PictureEdit dictionary,
            with the additional items placed in a new dictionary named PictureEditExtended.
            This allows the earlier versions of the application to continue to work as before, while
            later versions are able to locate and use the extended data items.
9.5 Marked Content
    Marked-content operators (PDF 1.2) identify a portion of a PDF content stream as
    a marked-content element of interest to a particular application or PDF plug-in
    extension. Marked-content elements and the operators that mark them fall into
    two categories:
    • The MP and DP operators designate a single marked-content point in the con-
       tent stream.
    • The BMC, BDC, and EMC operators bracket a marked-content sequence of ob-
       jects within the content stream. Note that this is not simply a sequence of bytes
       in the content stream, but of complete graphics objects. Each object is fully
       qualiﬁed by the parameters of the graphics state in which it is rendered.
    A graphics application, for example, might use marked content to identify a set of
    related objects as a “group” to be processed as a single unit. A text-processing
    application might use it to maintain a connection between a footnote marker in
    the body of a document and the corresponding footnote text at the bottom of the
    page. Table 9.8 summarizes the marked-content operators.
    All marked-content operators except EMC take a tag operand indicating the role
    or signiﬁcance of the marked-content element to the processing application. All
    such tags must be registered with Adobe Systems (see Appendix E) to avoid con-
    ﬂicts between different applications marking the same content stream. In addi-
    tion to the tag operand, the DP and BDC operators specify a property list
    containing further information associated with the marked content. Property
    lists are discussed further in Section 9.5.1, “Property Lists.”
    Marked-content operators may appear only between graphics objects in the con-
    tent stream; they may not occur within a graphics object or between a graphics
    state operator and its operands. Marked-content sequences may be nested one
    within another, but each sequence must be entirely contained within a single
    content stream; it may not cross page boundaries, for example.
    Note: The Contents entry of a page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87), which
    may be either a single stream or an array of streams, is considered a single stream
    with respect to marked-content sequences.

           When the marked-content operators BMC, BDC, and EMC are combined with the
           text object operators BT and ET (see Section 5.3, “Text Objects”), each pair of
           matching operators (BMC…EMC, BDC…EMC, or BT…ET) must be properly
           (separately) nested. That is, the sequences

9.5.1 Property Lists
      The marked-content operators DP and BDC associate a property list with a
      marked-content element within a content stream. This is a dictionary containing
      private information meaningful to the program (application or plug-in exten-
      sion) creating the marked content. Although the dictionary may contain any
      entries the program wishes to place there, it is suggested that any particular pro-
      gram use the entries in a consistent way; for example, the values associated with a
      given key should always be of the same type (or small set of types).
      If all of the values in a property list dictionary are direct objects, the dictionary
      may be written inline in the content stream as a direct object. If any of the values
      are indirect references to objects outside the content stream, the property list
      dictionary must instead be deﬁned as a named resource in the Properties sub-
      dictionary of the current resource dictionary (see Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dic-
      tionaries”) and then referenced by name as the properties operand of the DP or
      BDC operator.
9.5.2 Marked Content and Clipping
      Some PDF path and text objects are deﬁned purely for their effect on the current
      clipping path, without themselves actually being painted on the page. This occurs
      when a path object is deﬁned using the operator sequence W n or W* n (see
      Section 4.4.3, “Clipping Path Operators”) or when a text object is painted in text
      rendering mode 7 (see Section 5.2.5, “Text Rendering Mode”). Such clipped,
      unpainted path or text objects are called clipping objects. When a clipping object
      falls within a marked-content sequence, it is not considered part of the sequence
      unless the entire sequence consists only of clipping objects. In Example 9.2, for
      instance, the marked-content sequence tagged Clip includes the text string
      (Clip me), but not the rectangular path that deﬁnes the clipping boundary.

      Only when a marked-content sequence consists entirely of clipping objects are
      the clipping objects considered part of the sequence. In this case, the sequence is
known as a marked clipping sequence. Such sequences may be nested. In Example
9.3, for instance, multiple lines of text are used to clip a subsequent graphics
object (in this case, a ﬁlled path). Each line of text is bracketed within a separate
marked clipping sequence, tagged Pgf; the entire series is bracketed in turn by an
outer marked clipping sequence, tagged Clip. Note, however, that the marked-
content sequence tagged ClippedText is not a marked clipping sequence, since it
contains a ﬁlled rectangular path that is not a clipping object. The clipping
objects belonging to the Clip and Pgf sequences are therefore not considered part
of the ClippedText sequence.

The precise rules governing marked clipping sequences are as follows:
• A clipping object is a path object ended by the operator sequence W n or W* n or
  a text object painted in text rendering mode 7.
• An invisible graphics object is a path object ended by the operator n only (with
  no preceding W or W*) or a text object painted in text rendering mode 3.
• A visible graphics object is a path object ended by any operator other than n, a
  text object painted in any text rendering mode other than 3 or 7, or any
  XObject invoked by the Do operator.
• An empty marked-content element is a marked-content point or a marked-
  content sequence that encloses no graphics objects.
• A marked clipping sequence is a marked-content sequence that contains at least
   one clipping object and no visible graphics objects.
• Clipping objects and marked clipping sequences are considered part of an
   enclosing marked-content sequence only if it is a marked clipping sequence.
• Invisible graphics objects and empty marked-content elements are always con-
   sidered part of an enclosing marked-content sequence, regardless of whether it
   is a marked clipping sequence.
• The q (save) and Q (restore) operators may not occur within a marked clipping
   sequence.
Example 9.4 illustrates the application of these rules. Marked-content sequence
S4 is a marked clipping sequence, because it contains a clipping object (clipping
path 2) and no visible graphics objects. Clipping path 2 is therefore considered
part of sequence S4. Marked-content sequences S1, S2, and S3 are not marked
clipping sequences, since they each include at least one visible graphics object.
Thus clipping paths 1 and 2 are not part of any of these three sequences.

    In Example 9.5, marked-content sequence S1 is a marked clipping sequence,
    because the only graphics object it contains is a clipping path. Thus the empty
    marked-content sequence S3 and the marked-content point P1 are both part of
    sequence S2, and S2, S3, and P1 are all part of sequence S1.

    In Example 9.6, marked-content sequences S1 and S4 are marked clipping
    sequences, because the only object they contain is a clipping path. Hence the
    clipping path is part of sequences S1 and S4; S3 is part of S2; and S2, S3, and S4
    are all part of S1.

9.6 Logical Structure
    PDF’s logical structure facilities (PDF 1.3) provide a mechanism for incorporating
    structural information about a document’s content into a PDF ﬁle. Such in-
    formation might include, for example, the organization of the document into
    chapters and sections or the identiﬁcation of special elements such as ﬁgures,
      tables, and footnotes. The logical structure facilities are extensible, allowing
      applications that produce PDF ﬁles to choose what structural information to
      include and how to represent it, while enabling PDF consumers to navigate a ﬁle
      without knowing the producer’s structural conventions.
      PDF logical structure shares basic features with standard document markup
      languages such as HTML, SGML, and XML. A document’s logical structure is
      expressed as a hierarchy of structure elements, each represented by a dictionary
      object. Like their counterparts in other markup languages, PDF structure
      elements can have content and attributes. Their content can consist of references
      to document content, references to other structure elements, or both. In PDF,
      however, rendered document content takes over the role occupied by text in
      HTML, SGML, and XML.
      A PDF document’s logical structure is stored separately from its visible content,
      with pointers from each to the other. This separation allows the ordering and
      nesting of logical elements to be entirely independent of the order and location of
      graphics objects on the document’s pages.
9.6.1 Structure Hierarchy
      The logical structure of a document is described by a hierarchy of objects called
      the structure hierarchy or structure tree. At the root of the hierarchy is a dictionary
      object called the structure tree root, located via the StructTreeRoot entry in the
      document catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Catalog”). The remainder of the
      hierarchy is formed of intermediate nodes called structure elements. At the leaves
      of the tree are individual content items associated with structure elements; these
      may be marked-content sequences, complete PDF objects, or other structure
      elements.
      Tables 9.9 and 9.10 show the contents of the structure tree root and a structure
      element, respectively.

   9.6.2 Structure Types
           Every structure element has a structure type, a name object that identiﬁes the
           nature of the structure element and its role within the document (such as a chap-
           ter, paragraph, or footnote). To facilitate the interchange of content among PDF
           applications, Adobe has deﬁned a set of standard structure types; see Section
           9.7.4, “Standard Structure Types.” Applications are not required to adopt them,
           however, but may use any names they wish for their structure types.
      Where names other than the standard ones are used, a role map may be provided
      in the structure tree root, mapping the structure types used in the document to
      their nearest equivalents in the standard set. For example, a structure type named
      Section used in the document might be mapped to the standard type Sect. The
      equivalence need not be exact; the role map merely indicates an approximate
      analogy between types, allowing applications other than the one creating a docu-
      ment to handle its nonstandard structure elements in a reasonable way.
      Note: The same structure type may occur as both a key and a value in the role map,
      and circular chains of association are explicitly permitted. A single role map can thus
      deﬁne a bidirectional mapping. An application using the role map should follow the
      chain of associations until it either ﬁnds a structure type it recognizes or returns to
      one it has already encountered.
9.6.3 Structure Content
      The content of a structure element may consist of one or more content items of
      any of the following kinds:
      • Marked-content sequences embedded within content streams
      • Complete PDF objects such as annotations and XObjects
      • Other structure elements
      The K entry in a structure element dictionary can have as its value either a single
      object denoting one of these items or an array of such objects. Items of any or all
      three kinds may be mixed in the same content array. The following sections
      describe how each kind of content item is denoted in a structure element’s K
      entry.
      Marked-Content Sequences as Content Items
      For a sequence of graphics operators in a content stream to be included in the
      content of a structure element, they must be bracketed as a marked-content
      sequence between BDC and EMC operators (see Section 9.5, “Marked Content”).
      Furthermore, the marked-content sequence must have a property list (see Sec-
      tion 9.5.1, “Property Lists”) containing an MCID entry. This entry deﬁnes an
      integer marked-content identiﬁer that uniquely identiﬁes the marked-content
      sequence within its content stream. The structure element can then refer to the
       sequence by specifying its content stream and its marked-content identiﬁer
       within the stream.
       Note: Although the tag associated with a marked-content sequence is not directly
       related to the document’s logical structure, it should be the same as the structure type
       of the associated structure element.
       In the general case, a structure element refers to a marked-content sequence by
       means of a dictionary object called a marked-content reference. Table 9.11 shows
       the contents of this type of dictionary.

Marked-content sequences can be used to incorporate the content of a form
XObject into a structure element in either of two ways:
• In the content stream that paints the form XObject with the            Do operator,
  enclose the invocation of Do within a marked-content sequence and associate
  that sequence with the desired structure element (see Example 9.8). The entire
  content of the form XObject is considered to be part of the structure element’s
  content, as if it were inserted into the marked-content sequence at the point of
  the Do operator. The form XObject has no internal substructure of its own and
  cannot in turn contain any marked-content sequences associated with this or
  other structure elements.
• In the content stream of the form XObject itself, enclose the desired content in
  a marked-content sequence associated with the structure element (see Example
  9.9). The Do operator that paints the form XObject should not be part of any
  logical structure content item. However, in this case the form XObject itself can
  have arbitrary substructure, containing any number of marked-content se-
  quences associated with logical structure elements.
Note: A form XObject that is painted with multiple invocations of the Do operator
can be incorporated into the document’s logical structure only by the ﬁrst method,
with each invocation of Do individually associated with a structure element.

In the common case where all or most of the marked-content sequences in a
structure element’s content are on the same page, the Pg entry identifying the
page can be supplied in the structure element dictionary itself (see Table 9.10 on
page 591), rather than in a separate marked-content reference for each sequence.
Often, this allows the marked-content reference to be dispensed with entirely and
the sequence identiﬁed in the structure element’s K entry by simply giving its
integer marked-content identiﬁer directly, as in Example 9.8 above.
PDF Objects as Content Items
When a structure element’s content includes an entire PDF object, such as an
XObject or an annotation, that is associated with a page but not directly included
in the page’s content stream, the object is identiﬁed in the structure element’s K
entry by an object reference dictionary (see Table 9.12). Note that this form of ref-
erence is used only for entire objects; if the referenced content forms only part of
the object’s content stream, it is instead handled as a marked-content sequence,
as described in the preceding section.

                                                                                                    ment containing the object reference; it is required if the structure element has no such
                                                                                                    entry.

     Note: If the referenced object is rendered on multiple pages, each rendering requires a
     separate object reference; but if it is rendered multiple times on the same page, just a
     single object reference sufﬁces to identify all of them. (If it is important to distinguish
     between multiple renditions of the same XObject on the same page, they should be
     accessed via marked-content sequences enclosing particular invocations of the Do
     operator, rather than via object references.)
     Structure Elements as Content Items
     One structure element can contain another as a content item simply by referring
     to the other structure element in its K entry. Example 9.10 shows a structure ele-
     ment containing other structure elements as content items, along with a marked-
     content sequence from a page’s content stream.
     Example 9.10

Finding Structure Elements from Content Items
Because a stream cannot contain object references, there is no way for content
items that are marked-content sequences to refer directly back to their parent
structure elements (the ones to which they belong as content items). Instead, a
different mechanism, the structural parent tree, is provided for this purpose. For
consistency, content items that are entire PDF objects, such as XObjects, also use
the parent tree to refer to their parent structure elements.
The parent tree is a number tree (see Section 3.8.5, “Number Trees”), accessed via
the ParentTree entry in a document’s structure tree root (Table 9.9 on page 590).
The tree contains an entry for each object that is a content item of at least one
structure element and for each content stream containing at least one marked-
content sequence that is a content item. The key for each entry is an integer given
as the value of the StructParent or StructParents entry in the object (see below).
The values of these entries are as follows:
• For an object identiﬁed as a content item by means of an object reference (see
   “PDF Objects as Content Items” on page 598), the value is an indirect reference
   to the parent structure element.
• For a content stream containing marked-content sequences that are content
   items, the value is an array of indirect references to the sequences’ parent struc-
   ture elements. The array element corresponding to each sequence is found by
   using the sequence’s marked-content identiﬁer as a zero-based index into the
   array.
Note: Because marked-content identiﬁers serve as indices into an array in the struc-
tural parent tree, their assigned values should be as small as possible to conserve
space in the array.
The ParentTreeNextKey entry in the structure tree root holds an integer value
greater than any that is currently in use as a key in the structural parent tree.
Whenever a new entry is added to the parent tree, it uses the current value of
ParentTreeNextKey as its key; the value is then incremented to prepare for the
next new entry to be added.
To locate the relevant parent tree entry, each object or content stream that is rep-
resented in the tree must contain a special dictionary entry, StructParent or
StructParents (see Table 9.13). Depending on the type of content item, this entry
may appear in the page object of a page containing marked-content sequences, in
the stream dictionary of a form or image XObject, in an annotation dictionary, or
in any other type of object dictionary that is included as a content item in a struc-
ture element. Its value is the integer key under which the entry corresponding to
the object is to be found in the structural parent tree.

                                                                                                    Note: At most one of these two entries may be present in a given object. An object
                                                                                                    can be either a content item in its entirety or a container for marked-content
                                                                                                    sequences that are content items, but not both.
           For a content item identiﬁed by an object reference, the parent structure element
           can thus be found by using the value of the StructParent entry in the item’s object
           dictionary as a retrieval key in the structural parent tree (found in the ParentTree
           entry of the structure tree root). The corresponding value retrieved from the
           parent tree is a reference to the parent structure element (see Example 9.11).

For a content item that is a marked-content sequence, the retrieval method is
similar but slightly more complicated. Because a marked-content sequence is not
an object in its own right, its parent tree key is found in the StructParents entry
of the page object or other content stream in which the sequence resides. The
value retrieved from the parent tree is not a reference to the parent structure ele-
ment itself, but rather an array of such references—one for each marked-content
sequence contained within that content stream. The parent structure element for
the given sequence is found by using the sequence’s marked-content identiﬁer as
an index into this array (see Example 9.12).

  9.6.4 Structure Attributes
        An application or plug-in extension that processes logical structure can attach
        additional information, called attributes, to any structure element. The attribute
        information is held in an attribute object associated with the structure element.
        Any dictionary or stream can serve as an attribute object by including an O entry
        (see Table 9.14) identifying the application or plug-in that owns the attribute
        information; the owner can then add any additional entries it wishes to the object
        to hold the attributes. To facilitate the interchange of content among PDF appli-
        cations, Adobe has deﬁned a set of standard structure attributes, identiﬁed by
        speciﬁc standard owners; see Section 9.7.5, “Standard Structure Attributes.”
                          TABLE 9.14 Entry common to all attribute objects
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE
O                                       name                                                        (Required) The name of the application or plug-in extension owning the attribute data.
                                                                                                    The name must conform to the guidelines described in Appendix E.
        Any application can attach attributes to any structure element, even one created
        by another application. Multiple applications can attach attributes to the same
        structure element; the A entry in the structure element dictionary (see Table 9.10
        on page 591) can hold either a single attribute object or an array of such objects,
        together with revision numbers for coordinating attributes created by different
        owner (see “Attribute Revision Numbers” on page 606). An application creating
        or destroying the second attribute object for a structure element is responsible
        for converting the value of the A entry from a single object to an array or vice
        versa, as well as for maintaining the integrity of the revision numbers. No in-
        herent order is deﬁned for the attribute objects in an A array, but it is considered
        good practice to add new objects at the end of the array so that the ﬁrst array
        element is the one belonging to the application that originally created the struc-
        ture element.
        Attribute Classes
        If many structure elements share the same set of attribute values, they can be
        deﬁned as an attribute class sharing the identical attribute object. Structure
        elements refer to the class by name; the association between class names and
attribute objects is deﬁned by a dictionary called the class map, kept in the
ClassMap entry of the structure tree root (see Table 9.9 on page 590). Each key in
the class map is a name object denoting the name of a class; the corresponding
value is an attribute object or an array of such objects.
Note: Despite the name, PDF attribute classes are unrelated to the concept of a class
in object-oriented programming languages such as Java™ and C++. Attribute classes
are strictly a mechanism for storing attribute information in a more compact form;
they have no inheritance properties like those of true object-oriented classes.
The C entry in a structure element dictionary (see Table 9.10 on page 591) con-
tains a class name or an array of class names (typically accompanied by revision
numbers as well; see “Attribute Revision Numbers,” below). For each class named
in the C entry, the corresponding attribute object or objects are considered to be
attached to the given structure element along with those identiﬁed in the
element’s A entry. (If both the A and C entries are present and a given attribute is
speciﬁed by both, the one speciﬁed by the A entry takes precedence.)
Attribute Revision Numbers
When an application modiﬁes a structure element or its contents, the change
may affect the validity of attribute information attached to that structure element
by other applications. A system of revision numbers allows applications to detect
such changes made by other applications and update their own attribute infor-
mation accordingly.
A structure element’s revision number is kept in the R entry in the structure
element dictionary (see Table 9.10 on page 591). Initially, the revision number is
0 (the default value if no R entry is present); each time an application modiﬁes
the structure element or any of its content items, it must signal the change by
incrementing the revision number. Note that the revision number is not the same
thing as the generation number associated with an indirect object (see Section
3.2.9, “Indirect Objects”); the two are completely separate concepts.
As described below, each attribute object attached to a structure element carries
an associated revision number. Each time an attribute object is created or modi-
ﬁed, its revision number is set equal to the current value of the structure
element’s R entry. By comparing the attribute object’s revision number with that
of the structure element, an application can tell whether the contents of the
      attribute object are still current or whether they have been outdated by more
      recent changes in the underlying structure element.
      Because a single attribute object may be associated with more than one structure
      element (whose revision numbers may differ), the revision number is not stored
      directly in the attribute object itself, but rather in the array that associates the
      attribute object with the structure element. This allows the same attribute object
      to carry different revision numbers with respect to different structure elements.
      In the general case, each attribute object in a structure element’s A array is repre-
      sented by a pair of array elements, the ﬁrst containing the attribute object itself
      and the second the integer revision number associated with it in this structure
      element. Similarly, the structure element’s C array contains a pair of elements for
      each attribute class, the ﬁrst containing the class name and the second the associ-
      ated revision number. (Revision numbers equal to 0 can be omitted from both
      the A and C arrays; an attribute object or class name that is not followed by an
      integer array element is understood to have a revision number of 0.)
      Note: A structure element’s revision number changes only when the structure ele-
      ment itself or any of its content items is modiﬁed. Changes in an attached attribute
      object do not change the structure element’s revision number (though they may
      cause the attribute object’s revision number to be updated to match it).
      Occasionally, an application may make such extensive changes to a structure
      element that they are likely to invalidate all previous attribute information associ-
      ated with it. In this case, instead of incrementing the structure element’s revision
      number, the application may choose to delete all unknown attribute objects from
      its A and C arrays. These two actions are mutually exclusive: the application
      should either increment the structure element’s revision number or remove its
      attribute objects, but not both. Note that any application creating attribute ob-
      jects must be prepared for the possibility that they may be deleted at any time by
      another application.
9.6.5 Example of Logical Structure
      Example 9.13 shows portions of a PDF ﬁle with a simple document structure.
      The structure tree root (object 300) contains elements with structure types Chap
      (object 301) and Para (object 304). The Chap element, titled Chapter 1, contains
      elements with types Head1 (object 302) and Para (object 303). The example also
illustrates the structure of a parent tree (object 400) mapping content items back
to their parent structure elements, and an ID tree (object 403) mapping element
identiﬁers to the structure elements they denote.

9.7 Tagged PDF
    Tagged PDF (PDF 1.4) is a stylized use of PDF that builds on the logical structure
    framework described in Section 9.6, “Logical Structure,” by deﬁning a set of stan-
    dard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and
    images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes. In addition, it deﬁnes a set
    of rules for representing text in the page content so that characters, words, and
      text order can be determined reliably. It is intended for use by tools that perform
      operations such as:
      • Simple extraction of text and graphics for pasting into other applications
      • Automatic reﬂow of text and associated graphics to ﬁt a page of a different size
        than was assumed for the original layout
      • Processing text for such purposes as searching, indexing, and spell-checking
      • Conversion to other common ﬁle formats (such as HTML, XML, and RTF)
        with document structure and basic styling information preserved
      • Making content accessible to the visually impaired
      Tagged PDF encompasses three interrelated sets of conventions:
      • Page content. All text is represented in a form that can be converted to Unicode.
        Word breaks are represented explicitly. Actual content is distinguished from
        artifacts of layout and pagination. Content is given in an order related to its
        appearance on the page, as determined by the authoring application.
      • Structure types. A set of standard structure types deﬁne the meaning of struc-
        ture elements such as paragraphs, headings, articles, and tables.
      • Structure attributes. Standard structure attributes preserve styling information
        used by the authoring application in laying out content on the page.
      Note: Tagged PDF is not intended to limit the use of logical structure to only the spe-
      ciﬁc types and attributes described here, but rather to provide a set of standard fall-
      back roles and minimum guaranteed attributes in order to enable consumer
      applications to perform operations such as those mentioned above. Producer appli-
      cations are free to deﬁne additional structure types, so long as they also provide a role
      mapping to the nearest equivalent standard types, as described in Section 9.6.2,
      “Structure Types.” Likewise, producer applications are free to deﬁne additional struc-
      ture attributes using any of the available extension mechanisms.
9.7.1 Mark Information Dictionary
      The optional MarkInfo entry in the document catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Docu-
      ment Catalog”) holds a mark information dictionary describing a document’s
      usage of Tagged PDF. As shown in Table 9.15, this dictionary contains a single
      entry, Marked, whose value is a boolean ﬂag indicating whether the document
        conforms to Tagged PDF conventions. For a document to be recognized as a
        Tagged PDF document, its catalog must contain such a dictionary with the value
        of the Marked ﬂag set to true.
                        TABLE 9.15 Entry in the mark information dictionary
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE
Marked                                  boolean                                                     (Optional) A ﬂag indicating whether the document conforms to Tagged PDF
                                                                                                    conventions. Default value: false.
  9.7.2 Tagged PDF and Page Content
        Like all PDF documents, a Tagged PDF document consists of a sequence of self-
        contained pages, each of which is described by one or more page content streams
        (including any subsidiary streams such as form XObjects and annotation appear-
        ances). Tagged PDF deﬁnes some further conventions for organizing and mark-
        ing content streams so that additional information can be derived from them.
        These conventions include:
        • Distinguishing between the author’s original content and artifacts of the layout
          process
        • Specifying a content order to guide the layout process if the page content must
          be reﬂowed
        • Representing text in a form from which a Unicode representation and informa-
          tion about font characteristics can be unambiguously derived
        • Representing word breaks unambiguously
        • Marking text with information for making it accessible to the visually impaired
        Real Content and Artifacts
        The graphics objects in a page’s content stream can be divided into two classes:
        real content and artifacts. The document’s logical structure encompasses all
        graphics objects making up the real content and describes how those objects
        relate to one another; it does not include graphics objects that are mere artifacts
        of the layout and production process.
The real content of a document comprises objects representing material originally
introduced by the document’s author. This includes not only the page content
stream and subsidiary form XObjects, but also any associated annotations meet-
ing all of the following conditions:
• The annotation has an appearance stream (see Section 8.4.4, “Appearance
   Streams”) containing a normal (N) appearance.
• The annotation’s Hidden ﬂag (see Section 8.4.2, “Annotation Flags”) is not set.
• The annotation is included in the document’s logical structure (see Section 9.6,
   “Logical Structure”).
Artifacts are graphics objects that are not part of the author’s original content but
rather are generated by the PDF producer application in the course of pagination,
layout, or other strictly mechanical processes. They include:
• Pagination artifacts. Ancillary page features such as running heads and folios
   (page numbers).
• Layout artifacts. Purely cosmetic typographical or design elements such as foot-
   note rules or background screens.
• Page artifacts. Production aids extraneous to the document itself, such as cut
   marks and color bars.
Tagged PDF consumer applications may have their own ideas about what page
content to consider relevant. A text-to-speech engine, for instance, probably
should not speak running heads or page numbers when the page is turned. In
general, consumer applications are allowed to:
• Disregard elements of page content (for example, speciﬁc types of artifact) that
   are not of interest
• Treat some page elements as terminals that are not to be examined further (for
   example, to treat an illustration as a unit for reﬂow purposes)
• Replace an element with alternate text (see Section 9.8.2, “Alternate Descrip-
   tions”)
Depending on their speciﬁc goals, different consumer applications may make dif-
ferent decisions in this regard. The purpose of Tagged PDF is not to prescribe
what the consumer application should do, but to provide sufﬁcient declarative
         and descriptive information to allow it to make its own appropriate choices about
         how to process the content.
         Note: To support consumer applications in providing accessibility to disabled users,
         Tagged PDF documents should use the natural language speciﬁcation (Lang), alter-
         nate description (Alt), replacement text (ActualText), and abbreviation expansion
         text (E) facilities described in Section 9.8, “Accessibility Support.”
         Speciﬁcation of Artifacts
         An artifact is distinguished from real content by enclosing it in a marked-content
         sequence with the tag Artifact:
            /Artifact                                      /Artifact propertyList
                BMC                                           BDC
                   …                    or                        …
                EMC                                           EMC
         The ﬁrst form is used to identify a generic artifact, the second for those that have
         an associated property list. Table 9.16 shows the properties that can be included
         in such a property list.
                                TABLE 9.16 Property list entries for artifacts
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE

                                                                                                    any, to which the artifact is logically attached. Page edges are deﬁned by the
                                                                                                    page’s crop box (see Section 9.10.1, “Page Boundaries”). The ordering of names
                                                                                                    within the array is immaterial. Including both Left and Right or both Top and
                                                                                                    Bottom indicates a full-width or full-height artifact, respectively.
Note: To aid in text reﬂow, it is recommended that artifacts be deﬁned with property
lists whenever possible. Artifacts lacking a speciﬁed bounding box are likely to be dis-
carded during reﬂow.
Incidental Artifacts
In addition to objects that are explicitly marked as artifacts, the running text of a
page may contain other elements and relationships that are not logically part of
the document’s real content, but merely incidental results of the process of laying
out that content into a document. Since these incidental artifacts represent varia-
tions between the document’s logical content and its visible representation, they
are not reﬂected in its logical structure within the Tagged PDF ﬁle. They may
include the following:
• Hyphenation. Among the artifacts introduced by text layout is the hyphen
   marking the incidental division of a word at the end of a line. In Tagged PDF,
   such an incidental word division must be represented by a soft hyphen charac-
   ter, which the Unicode mapping algorithm (see “Unicode Mapping” on page
   620) translates to the Unicode value U+00AD. (This is distinct from an ordinary
   hard hyphen, whose Unicode value is U+002D.) The producer of a Tagged PDF
   document must distinguish explicitly between soft and hard hyphens, so that
   the consumer does not have to guess which type a given character represents.
• Text discontinuities. The running text of a page, as expressed in page content
   order (see “Page Content Order,” below), may contain places where the normal
   progression of text suffers a discontinuity. For example, the page may contain
   the beginnings of two separate articles (see Section 8.3.2, “Articles”), each of
   which is continued onto a later page of the document; the last words of the ﬁrst
   article appearing on the page should not be run together with the ﬁrst words of
   the second. Consumer applications can recognize such discontinuities by
   examining the document’s logical structure.
• Hidden page elements. For a variety of reasons, elements of a document’s logical
   content may be invisible on the page: they may be clipped, their color may
   match the background, or they may be obscured by other, overlapping objects.
   Consumer applications must still be able to recognize and process such hidden
   elements; for example, formerly invisible elements may become visible when a
   page is reﬂowed, or a text-to-speech engine may wish to speak text that is not
   visible to a sighted reader. For the purposes of Tagged PDF, page content is con-
   sidered to include all text and illustrations in their entirety, whether or not they
   are visible when the document is displayed or printed.
Page Content Order
When dealing with material on a page-by-page basis, some Tagged PDF consum-
er applications may wish to process elements in page content order, determined by
the sequencing of graphics objects within a page’s content stream and of charac-
ters within a text object, rather than in the logical structure order deﬁned by a
depth-ﬁrst traversal of the page’s logical structure hierarchy. The two orderings
are logically distinct and may or may not coincide; in particular, any artifacts the
page may contain are included in the page content order but not in the logical
structure order, since they are not considered part of the document’s logical
structure. The creator of a Tagged PDF document is responsible for establishing
both an appropriate page content order for each page and an appropriate logical
structure hierarchy for the entire document.
Because the primary requirement for page content order is to enable reﬂow to
maintain elements in proper reading sequence, it should normally (for Western
writing systems) proceed from top to bottom (and, in a multiple-column layout,
from column to column), with artifacts in their correct relative places. In general,
all parts of an article that appear on a given page should be kept together, even if
it ﬂows to scattered locations on the page. Illustrations or footnotes may be inter-
spersed with the text of the associated article or may appear at the end of its con-
tent (or, in the case of footnotes, at the end of the entire page’s logical content).
Sequencing of Annotations
Annotations associated with a page are not interleaved within the page’s content
stream, but are placed in the Annots array in its page object (see “Page Objects”
on page 87). Consequently, the correct position of an annotation in the page con-
tent order is not readily apparent, but is determined from the document’s logical
structure.
Both page content (marked-content sequences) and annotations can be treated as
content items that are referenced from structure elements (see Section 9.6.3,
“Structure Content”). Structure elements of type Link or Form (see “Inline-Level
Structure Elements” on page 632 and “Illustration Elements” on page 637) ex-
plicitly specify the association between a marked-content sequence and a corre-
sponding annotation. In other cases, if the structure element corresponding to an
annotation immediately precedes or follows (in the logical structure order) a
structure element corresponding to a marked-content sequence, the annotation
is considered to precede or follow the marked-content sequence, respectively, in
the page content order.
Note: If necessary, a Tagged PDF producer may introduce an empty marked-content
sequence solely to serve as a structure element for the purpose of positioning adjacent
annotations in the page content order.
Reverse-Order Show Strings
In writing systems that are read from right to left (such as Arabic or Hebrew), one
might expect that the glyphs in a font would have their origins at the lower right
and their widths (rightward horizontal displacements) speciﬁed as negative. For
various technical and historical reasons, however, many such fonts follow the
same conventions as those designed for Western writing systems, with glyph ori-
gins at the lower left and positive widths, as shown in Figure 5.4 on page 298.
Consequently, showing text in such right-to-left writing systems requires either
positioning each glyph individually (which is tedious and costly) or representing
text with show strings whose characters are given in reverse order. When the lat-
ter method is used, the characters’ correct page content order is the reverse of
their order within the show string.
The marked-content tag ReversedChars informs the Tagged PDF consumer appli-
cation that show strings within a marked-content sequence contain characters in
the reverse of page content order. If the sequence encompasses multiple show
strings, only the individual characters within each string are reversed; the strings
themselves are in natural reading order. For example, the sequence
    /ReversedChars
       BMC
          ( olleH) Tj
          −200 0 Td
          (.dlrow) Tj
       EMC
represents the text
    Hello world.
The show strings may have a space character at the beginning or end to indicate a
word break (see “Identifying Word Breaks” on page 622), but may not contain
interior spaces. This is not a serious limitation, since a space provides an oppor-
tunity to realign the typography without visible effect; and it serves the valuable
purpose of limiting the scope of reversals for word-processing consumer applica-
tions.
Extraction of Character Properties
Character codes in a Tagged PDF document can be unambiguously converted
into Unicode values representing the information content of the text, and some
characteristics of the associated fonts can be deduced. These Unicode values and
font characteristics can then be used for such operations as cut-and-paste editing,
searching, text-to-speech conversion, and exporting to other applications or ﬁle
formats.
Unicode Mapping
Every character code in a Tagged PDF document can be mapped to a corre-
sponding Unicode value. Unicode deﬁnes 16-bit values for most of the charac-
ters used in the world’s languages and writing systems, as well as providing a
vendor space that applications can use as a private escape area. Information
about Unicode can be found in the Unicode Standard, by the Unicode Consor-
tium (see the Bibliography).
The methods for mapping a character code to a Unicode value are as follows:
• If the font dictionary contains a ToUnicode CMap (see Section 5.9, “ToUnicode
   CMaps”), use that CMap to convert the character code to Unicode.
• If the font is a simple font that uses one of the predeﬁned encodings
   MacRomanEncoding, MacExpertEncoding, or WinAnsiEncoding, or that has an
   encoding whose Differences array includes only character names taken from
   the Adobe standard Latin character set and the set of named characters in the
   Symbol font (see Appendix D):
     1. Map the character code to a character name according to Table D.1 on
        page 710 and the font’s Differences array.
     2. Look up the character name in the Adobe Glyph List (see the Bibliography)
        to obtain the corresponding Unicode value.
• If the font is a composite font that uses one of the predeﬁned CMaps listed in
   Table 5.14 on page 343 (except Identity–H and Identity–V), or whose descendant
   CIDFont uses the Adobe-GB1, Adobe-CNS1, Adobe-Japan1, or Adobe-Korea1
   character collection:
     1. Map the character code to a character identiﬁer (CID) according to the
        font’s CMap.
     2. Obtain the registry and ordering of the character collection used by the
        font’s CMap (for example, Adobe and Japan1) from its CIDSystemInfo
        dictionary.
     3. Construct a second CMap name by concatenating the registry and order-
        ing obtained in step 2 in the format registry–ordering–UCS2 (for example,
        Adobe–Japan1–UCS2).
     4. Obtain the CMap with the name constructed in step 3 (available from the
        ASN Developer Program Web site; see the Bibliography).
     5. Map the CID obtained in step 1 according to the CMap obtained in step 4,
        producing a Unicode value.
If these methods fail to produce a Unicode value, there is no way to determine
what the character code represents. Tagged PDF producers should take care to
ensure that the PDF ﬁle contains enough information to map all characters to
Unicode by one of the methods described above.
Note: An Alt or ActualText entry in a structure element dictionary (see Sections
9.8.2, “Alternate Descriptions,” and 9.8.3, “Replacement Text”) or an E (expansion
text) property in a marked-content property list (Section 9.8.4, “Expansion of Abbre-
viations and Acronyms”) may affect the character stream that some Tagged PDF
consumers actually use. For example, some consumers may choose to use the Alt or
ActualText value and ignore all text and other content associated with the structure
element and its descendants.
Note: Some uses of Tagged PDF require characters that may not be available in all
fonts, such as the soft hyphen (see “Incidental Artifacts” on page 617). Such charac-
ters can be represented either by adding them to the font’s encoding or CMap and
using ToUnicode to map them to appropriate Unicode values, or by using an
ActualText entry in the associated structure element to provide substitute characters.
          Font Characteristics
          In addition to a Unicode value, each text character in a content stream has an as-
          sociated set of font characteristics. These characteristics are useful when export-
          ing text to another application or ﬁle format that has a limited repertoire of
          available fonts.
          Table 9.17 lists a common set of font characteristics corresponding to those used
          in CSS and XSL; more information can be found in the World Wide Web
          Consortium document Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) 1.0 (see the Bibliog-
          raphy). Each of the characteristics can be derived from information available in
          the font descriptor’s Flags entry (see Section 5.7.1, “Font Descriptor Flags”).
                               TABLE 9.17 Derivation of font characteristics
CHARACTERISTIC      TYPE         DERIVATION
Serifed             boolean      The value of the Serif ﬂag in the font descriptor’s Flags entry.
Proportional        boolean      The complement of the FixedPitch ﬂag in the font descriptor’s Flags entry.
Italic              boolean      The value of the Italic ﬂag in the font descriptor’s Flags entry.
Smallcap            boolean      The value of the SmallCap ﬂag in the font descriptor’s Flags entry.
          Note: The characteristics shown in the table apply only to characters contained in
          show strings within content streams; they do not exist for alternate description text
          (Alt), replacement text (ActualText), or abbreviation expansion text (E).
          Note: For the standard 14 Type 1 fonts, the font descriptor may be missing; the well-
          known values for those fonts are used.
          Identifying Word Breaks
          A document’s text stream deﬁnes not only the characters in a page’s text, but also
          the words. Unlike a character, the notion of a word is not precisely deﬁned, but
          depends on the purpose for which the text is being processed. A reﬂow tool needs
          to know where it can break the running text into lines; a text-to-speech engine
          needs to identify the words to be vocalized; spelling checkers and other applica-
          tions all have their own ideas of what constitutes a word. It is not important for a
          Tagged PDF document to identify the words within the text stream according to a
      single, unambiguous deﬁnition that will satisfy all of these clients; what is impor-
      tant is that there be enough information available for each client to make that
      determination for itself.
      The consumer of a Tagged PDF document ﬁnds words by sequentially examining
      the Unicode character stream, perhaps augmented by replacement text speciﬁed
      with ActualText (see Section 9.8.3, “Replacement Text”). It does not need to guess
      about word breaks based on information such as glyph positioning on the page,
      font changes, or glyph sizes. The main consideration is to ensure that the spacing
      characters that would be present to separate words in a pure text representation
      are also present in the Tagged PDF.
      Note that the identiﬁcation of what constitutes a word is unrelated to how the
      text happens to be grouped into show strings. The division into show strings has
      no semantic signiﬁcance; in particular, a space or other word-breaking character
      is still needed even if a word break happens to fall at the end of a show string.
      Note: Some applications may identify words by simply separating them at every
      space character; others may be slightly more sophisticated and treat punctuation
      marks such as hyphens or em dashes as word separators as well. Still other applica-
      tions may wish to identify possible line-break opportunities by using an algorithm
      similar to the one in Unicode Standard Annex #14, Line Breaking Properties, avail-
      able from the Unicode Consortium (see the Bibliography). (Note that this speciﬁca-
      tion implies that lines of text in Western writing systems usually end with a trailing
      space.)
9.7.3 Basic Layout Model
      Tagged PDF’s standard structure types and attributes are interpreted in the con-
      text of a basic layout model that determines how structure elements are to be
      arranged on the page. Although this model does not necessarily correspond to
      the one actually used for page layout by the application creating the document, it
      is designed to capture the general intent of the document’s underlying structure.
      (The PDF content stream itself speciﬁes the exact appearance.) The goal is to
      provide sufﬁcient information for Tagged PDF consumers to make their own lay-
      out decisions while preserving the authoring application’s intent as closely as
      their own layout models allow.
Note: The Tagged PDF layout model resembles the ones used in markup languages
such as HTML, CSS, XSL, and RTF, but does not correspond exactly to any of them.
The model is deliberately deﬁned loosely in order to allow reasonable latitude in the
interpretation of structure elements and attributes when converting to other docu-
ment formats; some degree of variation in the resulting layout from one format to
another is to be expected.
The basic layout model begins with the notion of a reference area. This is a rec-
tangular region used by the layout application as a frame or guide in which to
place the document’s content. Some of the standard structure attributes, such as
StartIndent and EndIndent (see “Layout Attributes for BLSEs” on page 642), are
measured from the boundaries of the reference area. Reference areas are not
speciﬁed explicitly, but are inferred from context; those of interest are generally
the column area or areas in a general text layout, the outer bounding box of a
table and those of its component cells, and the bounding box of an illustration
or other ﬂoating element.
The standard structure types are divided into four main categories according to
the roles they play in page layout:
• Grouping elements group other elements into sequences or hierarchies, but
   hold no content directly and have no direct effect on layout.
• Block-level structure elements (BLSEs) describe the overall layout of content on
   the page, proceeding in the block-progression direction.
• Inline-level structure elements (ILSEs) describe the layout of content within a
   BLSE, proceeding in the inline-progression direction.
• Illustration elements are compact sequences of content, in page content order,
   that are considered to be unitary objects with respect to page layout. An illus-
   tration can be treated as either a BLSE or an ILSE.
The meaning of the terms block-progression direction and inline-progression
direction depends on the writing system in use, as speciﬁed by the standard
attribute WritingMode (see “General Layout Attributes” on page 640). In Western
writing systems, the block direction is from top to bottom and the inline direc-
tion from left to right; other writing systems use different directions for laying
out content.
Because the progression directions can vary depending on the writing system,
edges of areas and directions on the page must be identiﬁed by terms that are
neutral with respect to the progression order rather than by familiar terms such
as up, down, left, and right. Block layout proceeds from before to after, inline
from start to end. Thus, for example, in Western writing systems the before and
after edges of a reference area are at the top and bottom, respectively, and the
start and end edges are at the left and right. Another term, shift direction (the
direction of shift for a superscript), refers to the direction opposite that for block
progression—that is, from after to before (in Western writing systems, from bot-
tom to top).
BLSEs are stacked within a reference area in block-progression order. In general,
the ﬁrst BLSE is placed against the before edge of the reference area; subsequent
BLSEs are then stacked against preceding ones, progressing toward the after edge,
until no more BLSEs will ﬁt in the reference area. If the overﬂowing BLSE allows
itself to be split—such as a paragraph that can be split between lines of text—a
portion of it may be included in the current reference area and the remainder
carried over to a subsequent reference area (either elsewhere on the same page or
on another page of the document). Once the amount of content that ﬁts in a ref-
erence area is determined, the placements of the individual BLSEs may be adjust-
ed to bias the placement toward the before edge, the middle, or the after edge of
the reference area, or the spacing within or between BLSEs may be adjusted to ﬁll
the full extent of the reference area.
Note: BLSEs may be nested, with child BLSEs stacked within a parent BLSE in the
same manner as BLSEs within a reference area. Except in a few instances noted
below, such nesting of BLSEs does not result in the nesting of reference areas; a single
reference area prevails for all levels of nested BLSEs.
Within a BLSE, child ILSEs are packed into lines. (Direct content items—those that
are immediate children of a BLSE rather than contained within a child ILSE—are
implicitly treated as ILSEs for packing purposes.) Each line is treated as a synthe-
sized BLSE and is stacked within the parent BLSE. Lines may be intermingled
with other BLSEs within the parent area. This line-building process is analogous
to the stacking of BLSEs within a reference area, except that it proceeds in the
inline-progression rather than the block-progression direction: a line is packed
with ILSEs beginning at the start edge of the containing BLSE and continuing
until the end edge is reached and the line is full. The overﬂowing ILSE may allow
itself to be broken at linguistically determined or explicitly marked break points
(such as hyphenation points within a word), and the remaining fragment is then
carried over to the next line.
      Note: Certain values of an element’s Placement attribute remove the element from
      the normal stacking or packing process and allow it instead to “ﬂoat” to a speciﬁed
      edge of the enclosing reference area or parent BLSE; see “General Layout Attributes”
      on page 640 for further discussion.
      Two enclosing rectangles are associated with each BLSE and ILSE (including
      direct content items that are treated implicitly as ILSEs):
      • The content rectangle is derived from the shape of the enclosed content and
         deﬁnes the bounds used for the layout of any included child elements.
      • The allocation rectangle includes any additional borders or spacing surround-
         ing the element, affecting how it will be positioned with respect to adjacent
         elements and the enclosing content rectangle or reference area.
      The deﬁnitions of these rectangles are determined by layout attributes associated
      with the structure element; see “Content and Allocation Rectangles” on page 648
      for further discussion.
9.7.4 Standard Structure Types
      Tagged PDF’s standard structure types characterize the role of a content element
      within the document and, in conjunction with the standard structure attributes
      (described in Section 9.7.5, “Standard Structure Attributes”), how that content is
      laid out on the page. As discussed in Section 9.6.2, “Structure Types,” the struc-
      ture type of a logical structure element is speciﬁed by the S entry in its structure
      element dictionary. To be considered a standard structure type, this value must
      be either:
      • One of the standard structure type names described below
      • An arbitrary name that is mapped to one of the standard names by the docu-
         ment’s role map (see Section 9.6.2, “Structure Types”), possibly via multiple
         levels of mapping
      Ordinarily, structure elements having standard structure types will be processed
      the same way whether the type is expressed directly or is determined indirectly
      via the role map. However, some consumer applications may ascribe additional
      semantics to nonstandard structure types, even though the role map associates
      them with standard ones. For instance, the actual values of the S entries may be
used when exporting to a tagged representation such as XML, while the corre-
sponding role-mapped values are used when converting to presentation formats
such as HTML or RTF, or for purposes such as reﬂow or accessibility to disabled
users.
Note: Most of the standard element types are designed primarily for laying out text;
the terminology reﬂects this usage. However, a layout can in fact include any type of
content, such as path or image objects. The content items associated with a structure
element are laid out on the page as if they were blocks of text (for a BLSE) or charac-
ters within a line of text (for an ILSE).
Grouping Elements
Grouping elements are used solely to group other structure elements; they are not
directly associated with content items. Table 9.18 describes the standard structure
types for elements in this category.
              TABLE 9.18 Standard structure types for grouping elements
STRUCTURE TYPE         DESCRIPTION
Document               (Document) A complete document. This is the root element of any
                       structure tree containing multiple parts or multiple articles.
Part                   (Part) A large-scale division of a document. This type of element is
                       appropriate for grouping articles or sections.
Art                    (Article) A relatively self-contained body of text constituting a
                       single narrative or exposition. Articles should be disjoint; that is,
                       they should not contain other articles as constituent elements.
Sect                   (Section) A container for grouping related content elements. For
                       example, a section might contain a heading, several introductory
                       paragraphs, and two or more other sections nested within it as sub-
                       sections.
Div                    (Division) A generic block-level element or group of elements.
BlockQuote             (Block quotation) A portion of text consisting of one or more para-
                       graphs attributed to someone other than the author of the sur-
                       rounding text.
Caption                (Caption) A brief portion of text describing a table or ﬁgure.
TOC                 (Table of contents) A list made up of list items (structure types L
                    and LI; see “List Elements” on page 630), each of which may contain
                    either a table of contents item (structure type TOCI; see below) or
                    another such list, along with a reference to the associated content
                    (structure type Reference; see “Inline-Level Structure Elements” on
                    page 632). A table of contents is thus potentially hierarchical; it is
                    desirable for the hierarchy to correspond in structure to the struc-
                    ture hierarchy of the main body of the document.
                    Note: Lists of ﬁgures and tables, as well as bibliographies, can be treat-
                    ed as tables of contents for purposes of the standard structure types.
TOCI                (Table of contents item) A piece of identifying text accompanied by
                    one or more references to the associated content (structure type
                    Reference; see “Inline-Level Structure Elements” on page 632). The
                    reference elements can be used to show the label, title, and page
                    number of the speciﬁed item in the main body of the document.
Index               (Index) A sequence of entries containing identifying text accompa-
                    nied by reference elements (structure type Reference; see “Inline-
                    Level Structure Elements” on page 632) that point out occurrences
                    of the speciﬁed text in the main body of a document.
NonStruct           (Nonstructural element) A grouping element having no inherent
                    structural signiﬁcance; it serves solely for grouping purposes. This
                    type of element differs from a division (structure type Div; see
                    above) in that it is not interpreted or exported to other document
                    formats; however, its descendants are to be processed normally.
Private             (Private element) A grouping element containing private content
                    belonging to the application producing it. The structural signiﬁ-
                    cance of this type of element is unspeciﬁed, and is determined en-
                    tirely by the producer application. Neither the Private element nor
                    any of its descendants are to be interpreted or exported to other
                    document formats.
For most content extraction formats, the document must be a tree with a single
top-level element; the structure tree root (identiﬁed by the StructTreeRoot entry
in the document catalog) must have only one child in its K (kids) array. If the
PDF ﬁle contains a complete document, the structure type Document is recom-
mended for this top-level element in the logical structure hierarchy; if the ﬁle
contains a well-formed document fragment, one of the structure types Part, Art,
Sect, or Div may be used instead.
Block-Level Structure Elements
A block-level structure element (BLSE) is any region of text or other content that is
laid out in the block-progression direction, such as a paragraph, heading, list
item, or footnote. A structure element is a BLSE if its structure type (after role
mapping, if any) is one of those listed in Table 9.19. All other standard structure
types are treated as ILSEs, with the following exceptions:
•  TR (Table row), TH (Table header), and TD (Table data), which are used to
   group elements within a table and are considered neither BLSEs nor ILSEs
• Elements with a Placement attribute (see “General Layout Attributes” on page
   640) other than the default value of Inline
                      TABLE 9.19 Block-level structure elements
CATEGORY                           STRUCTURE TYPES

                                   H                 H2                H5
                                                     H3                H6

Table element                      Table
In many cases, a BLSE appears as one compact, contiguous piece of page content;
in other cases, it is discontiguous. Examples of the latter include a BLSE that
extends across a page boundary or is interrupted in the page content order by
another, nested BLSE or a directly included footnote. When necessary, Tagged
PDF consumer applications can recognize such fragmented BLSEs from the logi-
cal structure and use this information to reassemble them and properly lay them
out.
Paragraphlike Elements
Table 9.20 describes structure types for paragraphlike elements that consist of
running text and other content laid out in the form of conventional paragraphs
(as opposed to more specialized layouts such as lists and tables).
          TABLE 9.20 Standard structure types for paragraphlike elements
STRUCTURE TYPE      DESCRIPTION
H                   (Heading) A label for a subdivision of a document’s content. It
                    should be the ﬁrst child of the division that it heads.
H1–H6               Headings with speciﬁc levels, for use in applications that cannot
                    hierarchically nest their sections and thus cannot determine the
                    level of a heading from its level of nesting.
P                   (Paragraph) A low-level division of text.
List Elements
The structure types described in Table 9.21 are used for organizing the content of
lists.
               TABLE 9.21 Standard structure types for list elements
STRUCTURE TYPE      DESCRIPTION
L                   (List) A sequence of items of like meaning and importance. Its im-
                    mediate children should be an optional caption (structure type
                    Caption; see “Grouping Elements” on page 627) followed by one or
                    more list items (structure type LI; see below).
LI                  (List item) An individual member of a list. Its children may be one
                    or more labels, list bodies, or both (structure types Lbl or LBody; see
                    below).
Lbl                 (Label) A name or number that distinguishes a given item from
                    others in the same list or other group of like items. In a dictionary
                    list, for example, it contains the term being deﬁned; in a bulleted or
                    numbered list, it contains the bullet character or the number of the
                    list item and associated punctuation.
LBody               (List body) The descriptive content of a list item. In a dictionary
                    list, for example, it contains the deﬁnition of the term. It can either
                    contain the content directly or have other BLSEs, perhaps including
                    nested lists, as children.
Table Elements
The structure types described in Table 9.22 are used for organizing the content of
tables.
                TABLE 9.22 Standard structure types for table elements
STRUCTURE TYPE        DESCRIPTION
Table                 (Table) A two-dimensional layout of rectangular data cells, possibly
                      having a complex substructure. It contains table rows (structure
                      type TR; see below) as children, and may have a caption (structure
                      type Caption; see “Grouping Elements” on page 627) as its ﬁrst or
                      last child.
TR                    (Table row) A row of headings or data in a table. It may contain
                      table header cells and table data cells (structure types TH and TD; see
                      below).
TH                    (Table header) A table cell containing header text describing one or
                      more rows or columns of the table.
TD                    (Table data) A table cell containing data that is part of the table’s
                      content.
                      Note: The association of headers with rows and columns of data is to
                      be determined heuristically by applications and is not deﬁned here.
Usage Guidelines for Block-Level Structure
Because different consumer applications use PDF’s logical structure facilities in
different ways, Tagged PDF does not enforce any strict rules regarding the order
and nesting of elements using the standard structure types. Furthermore, each
export format has its own conventions for logical structure. However, adhering to
certain general guidelines will help to achieve the most consistent and predictable
interpretation among different Tagged PDF consumers.
As described under “Grouping Elements” on page 627, a Tagged PDF document
can have one or more levels of grouping elements, such as Document, Part, Art
(Article), Sect (Section), and Div (Division). The descendants of these are BLSEs,
such as H (Heading), P (Paragraph), and L (List), that hold the actual content.
Their descendants, in turn, are the content items themselves or ILSEs that further
describe the content.
Note: As noted earlier, elements with structure types that would ordinarily be treated
as ILSEs can have a Placement attribute (see “General Layout Attributes” on page
640) that causes them to be treated as BLSEs instead. Such elements may be included
as BLSEs in the same manner as headings and paragraphs.
The block-level structure can follow one of two principal paradigms:
• Strongly structured. The grouping elements nest to as many levels as necessary
   to reﬂect the organization of the material into articles, sections, subsections,
   and so on. At each level, the children of the grouping element consist of a head-
   ing (H), one or more paragraphs (P) for content at that level, and perhaps one
   or more additional grouping elements for nested subsections.
• Weakly structured. The document is relatively ﬂat, having perhaps only one or
   two levels of grouping elements, with all the headings, paragraphs, and other
   BLSEs as their immediate children. In this case, the organization of the materi-
   al is not reﬂected in the logical structure; however, it can be expressed by the
   use of headings with speciﬁc levels (H1–H6).
The strongly structured paradigm is used by some rich document models based
on XML; the weakly structured paradigm is typical of documents represented in

Lists and tables should be organized using the speciﬁc structure types described
under “List Elements” on page 630 and “Table Elements” on page 631. Likewise,
tables of contents and indexes should be structured as described for the TOC and
Index structure types under “Grouping Elements” on page 627.
Inline-Level Structure Elements
An inline-level structure element (ILSE) contains a portion of text or other con-
tent having speciﬁc styling characteristics or playing a speciﬁc role in the docu-
ment. Within a paragraph or other block deﬁned by a containing BLSE,
consecutive ILSEs—possibly intermixed with other content items that are direct
children of the parent BLSE—are laid out consecutively in the inline-progression
direction (left to right in Western writing systems). The resulting content may
then be broken into multiple lines, which in turn are stacked in the block-
progression direction. It is possible for an ILSE in turn to contain a BLSE, which
is then treated as a unitary item of layout in the inline direction. Table 9.23 lists
the standard structure types for ILSEs.
        TABLE 9.23 Standard structure types for inline-level structure elements
STRUCTURE TYPE      DESCRIPTION
Span                (Span) A generic inline portion of text having no particular inher-
                    ent characteristics. It can be used, for example, to delimit a range of
                    text with a given set of styling attributes.
                    Note: Not all inline style changes need to be identiﬁed as a span. Text
                    color and font changes (including modiﬁers such as bold, italic, and
                    small caps) need not be so marked, since these can be derived from the
                    PDF content (see “Font Characteristics” on page 622). However, it is
                    necessary to use a span in order to apply explicit layout attributes such
                    as LineHeight, BaselineShift, or TextDecorationType (see “Layout
                    Attributes for ILSEs” on page 646).
                    Note: Marked-content sequences having the tag Span are also used to
                    carry certain accessibility properties (Lang and E; see Sections 9.8.1,
                    “Natural Language Speciﬁcation,” and 9.8.4, “Expansion of Abbrevia-
                    tions and Acronyms”). Such sequences lack an MCID property and are
                    not associated with any structure element. This use of the Span
                    marked-content tag is distinct from its use as a structure type.
Quote               (Quotation) An inline portion of text attributed to someone other
                    than the author of the surrounding text.
                    Note: The quoted text is contained inline within a single paragraph;
                    this differs from the block-level element BlockQuote (see “Grouping
                    Elements” on page 627), which consists of one or more complete para-
                    graphs (or other elements presented as if they were complete para-
                    graphs).
Note                (Note) An item of explanatory text, such as a footnote or an end-
                    note, that is referred to from within the body of the document. It
                    may have a label (structure type Lbl; see “List Elements” on page
                    630) as a child. The note itself may be included as a child of the
                    structure element in the body text that refers to it, or it may be
                    included elsewhere (such as in an endnotes section) and accessed
                    via a reference (structure type Reference; see below).
                    Note: Tagged PDF does not prescribe the placement of footnotes in the
                    page content order; they can be either inline or at the end of the page,
                    at the discretion of the producer application.
Reference           (Reference) A citation to content elsewhere in the document.
BibEntry              (Bibliography entry) A reference identifying the external source of
                      some cited content. It may contain a label (structure type Lbl; see
                      “List Elements” on page 630) as a child.
                      Note: Although a bibliography entry is likely to include component
                      parts identifying the cited content’s author, work, publisher, and so
                      forth, at the time of publication no standard structure types are
                      deﬁned at this level of detail.
Code                  (Code) A fragment of computer program text.
Link                  (Link) An association between a portion of the ILSE’s content and a
                      corresponding link annotation or annotations (see “Link Annota-
                      tions” on page 501). Its children are one or more content items or
                      child ILSEs and one or more object references (see “PDF Objects as
                      Content Items” on page 598) identifying the associated link annota-
                      tions. See “Link Elements,” below, for further discussion.
Link Elements
Link annotations (like all PDF annotations) are associated with a geometric
region of the page rather than with a particular object in its content stream. Any
connection between the link and the content is based solely on visual appearance
rather than on an explicitly speciﬁed association. For this reason, link annota-
tions in themselves are not useful to the visually impaired or to applications
needing to determine which content can be activated to invoke a hypertext link.
Tagged PDF link elements (structure type Link) use PDF’s logical structure facili-
ties to establish the association between content items and link annotations, pro-
viding functionality comparable to HTML hypertext links. The children of such
an element consist of:
• One or more content items or other ILSEs (except other links)
• Object references (see “PDF Objects as Content Items” on page 598) to one or
   more link annotations associated with the content
A link element may contain several link annotations if the geometry of the
content requires it; for instance, if a span of text wraps from the end of one line to
the beginning of another, separate link annotations may be needed in order to
cover the two portions of text. All of the child link annotations must have the
same target and action. In order to maintain a geometric association between the
content and the annotation that is consistent with the logical association, all of
the link element’s content must be covered by the union of its child link annota-
tions.
As an example, consider the following fragment of HTML code, which produces
a line of text containing a hypertext link:
    <html>
        <body>
           <p>
           Here is some text <a href=http://www.adobe.com>with a link</a> inside.
        </body>
    </html>
Example 9.14 shows an equivalent fragment of PDF using a link element, whose
text it displays in blue and underlined. Example 9.15 shows an excerpt from the
associated logical structure hierarchy.

Illustration Elements
Tagged PDF deﬁnes an illustration element as any structure element whose struc-
ture type (after role mapping, if any) is one of those listed in Table 9.24. The illus-
tration’s content must consist of one or more complete graphics objects; it may
not appear between the BT and ET operators delimiting a text object (see Section
5.3, “Text Objects”). It may include clipping only in the form of a contained
marked clipping sequence, as deﬁned in Section 9.5.2, “Marked Content and
Clipping.” In Tagged PDF, all such marked clipping sequences must carry the
marked-content tag Clip.
              TABLE 9.24 Standard structure types for illustration elements
STRUCTURE TYPE        DESCRIPTION
Figure                (Figure) An item of graphical content. Its placement may be speci-
                      ﬁed with the Placement layout attribute (see “General Layout Attri-
                      butes” on page 640).
Formula               (Formula) A mathematical formula.
                      Note: This structure type is useful only for identifying an entire con-
                      tent element as a formula; no standard structure types are deﬁned for
                      identifying individual components within the formula. From a for-
                      matting standpoint, the formula is treated similarly to a ﬁgure (struc-
                      ture type Figure; see above).
Form                  (Form) A widget annotation representing an interactive form ﬁeld
                      (see Section 8.6, “Interactive Forms”). Its only child is an object ref-
                      erence (see “PDF Objects as Content Items” on page 598) identify-
                      ing the widget annotation; the annotation’s appearance stream (see
                      Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”) deﬁnes the rendering of the
                      form element.
An illustration may have logical substructure, including other illustrations. For
purposes of reﬂow, however, it is moved (and perhaps resized) as a unit, without
examining its internal contents. To be useful for reﬂow, it must have a BBox
attribute; it may also have Placement, Width, Height, and BaselineShift attributes
(see “Layout Attributes” on page 639).
      Often an illustration will be logically part of, or at least attached to, a paragraph
      or other element of a document. Any such containment or attachment is repre-
      sented through the use of the Figure structure type; the Figure element indicates
      the point of attachment, while its Placement attribute describes the nature of the
      attachment. An illustration element without a Placement attribute is treated as
      an ILSE and laid out inline.
      Note: For accessibility to disabled users and other text extraction purposes, an illus-
      tration element should always have an Alt entry or an ActualText entry (or both) in
      its structure element dictionary (see Sections 9.8.2, “Alternate Descriptions,” and
      9.8.3, “Replacement Text”). Alt is a description of the illustration, whereas Actual-
      Text gives the exact text equivalent of a graphical illustration that has the appearance
      of text.
9.7.5 Standard Structure Attributes
      In addition to the standard structure types themselves, Tagged PDF also deﬁnes
      standard layout and styling attributes for structure elements of those types. These
      attributes enable predictable formatting to be applied during operations such as
      reﬂow and export of PDF content to other document formats.
      Note: In addition to the standard structure attributes, several other optional
      entries—Lang, Alt, and ActualText—can appear directly in the structure element
      dictionary rather than in an attribute dictionary. These are described in Section 9.8,
      “Accessibility Support,” but are useful to other PDF consumers as well.
      Standard Attribute Owners
      As discussed in Section 9.6.4, “Structure Attributes,” attributes are deﬁned in
      attribute objects, which are dictionaries or streams attached to a structure element
      in either of two ways:
      • The A entry in the structure element dictionary identiﬁes an attribute object or
         an array of such objects.
      • The C entry in the structure element dictionary gives the name of an attribute
         class or an array of such names. The class name is in turn looked up in the class
         map, a dictionary identiﬁed by the ClassMap entry in the structure tree root,
         yielding an attribute object corresponding to the class.
Each attribute object has an owner, speciﬁed by the object’s O entry, which deter-
mines the interpretation of the attributes deﬁned in the object’s dictionary. Mul-
tiple owners may deﬁne like-named attributes with different value types or
interpretations. Tagged PDF deﬁnes a set of standard attribute owners, shown in
Table 9.25.
                        TABLE 9.25 Standard attribute owners
OWNER                 DESCRIPTION
Layout                Attributes governing the layout of content

                      version 1.00
CSS-2.00              Additional attributes governing translation to a format using CSS,
                      version 2.00
An attribute object owned by a speciﬁc export format, such as XML-1.00, is
applied only when exporting PDF content to that format. Such format-speciﬁc
attributes override any corresponding attributes owned by Layout, List, or
Table. There may be also be additional format-speciﬁc attributes; the set of pos-
sible attributes is open-ended and is not explicitly speciﬁed or limited by Tagged
PDF.
Layout Attributes
Layout attributes specify parameters of the layout process used to produce the
appearance described by a document’s PDF content. Attributes in this category
are deﬁned in attribute objects whose O (owner) entry has the value Layout (or is
one of the format-speciﬁc owner names listed in Table 9.25 on page 639). The
intent is that these parameters can be used to reﬂow the content or export it to
some other document format with at least basic styling preserved.
Table 9.26 summarizes the standard layout attributes and the structure elements
to which they apply. The following sections describe the meaning and usage of
these attributes.

         Layout Attributes for BLSEs
         Table 9.28 describes layout attributes that apply only to block-level structure ele-

           Note: Inline-level structure elements (ILSEs) with a Placement attribute other than
           the default value of Inline are treated as BSLEs, and hence are also subject to the
           attributes described here.

                          The meaning of the term “reasonable value,” used above, is left to the con-
                          sumer application to determine; it can be assumed to be approximately 1.2
                          times the font size, but this value may vary depending on the export format.

                          it from glyph space to default user space (see Section 5.3.3, “Text Space De-

BaselineShift      number (Optional) The distance, in default user space units, by which the ele-
                          ment’s baseline is shifted relative to that of its parent element. The shift
                          direction is the opposite of the block-progression direction speciﬁed by
                          the prevailing WritingMode attribute (see “General Layout Attributes”
                          on page 640); thus positive values shift the baseline toward the before
                          edge and negative values toward the after edge of the reference area
                          (upward and downward, respectively, in Western writing systems).
                          Default value: 0.
                          The shifted element might be a superscript, a subscript, or an inline
                          graphic. The shift applies to the element itself, its content, and all of its
                          descendants. Any further baseline shift applied to a child of this element
                          is measured relative to the shifted baseline of this (parent) element.
TextDecorationType name   (Optional) The text decoration, if any, to be applied to the element’s text.
                               None              No text decoration
                               Underline         A line below the text
                               Overline          A line above the text
                               LineThrough       A line through the middle of the text
                          Default value: None.
                          This attribute applies to all text content items that are children of this
                          element or of its nested ILSEs, if any; it does not apply to nested BLSEs
                          or to content items other than text.
                          Note: The color, position, and thickness of the decoration should be uniform
                          across all children, in spite of changes in color, font size, or other variations
                          in the content’s text characteristics.
Content and Allocation Rectangles
As deﬁned in Section 9.7.3, “Basic Layout Model,” an element’s content rectangle
is an enclosing rectangle derived from the shape of the element’s content, which
deﬁnes the bounds used for the layout of any included child elements; the
allocation rectangle includes any additional borders or spacing surrounding the
element, affecting how it will be positioned with respect to adjacent elements and
the enclosing content rectangle or reference area.
The exact deﬁnition of the content rectangle depends on the element’s structure
type:
• For a table cell (structure type TH or TD), the content rectangle is determined
   from the bounding box of all graphics objects in the cell’s content, taking into
   account any explicit bounding boxes (such as the BBox entry in a form
   XObject). This implied size can be explicitly overridden by the cell’s Width and
   Height attributes. The cell’s height is then further adjusted to equal the maxi-
   mum height of any cell in its row, and its width to the maximum width of any
   cell in its column.
• For any other BLSE, the height of the content rectangle is the sum of the
   heights of all BLSEs it contains, plus any additional spacing adjustments
   between these elements.
• For an ILSE that contains text, the height of the content rectangle is set by the
   LineHeight attribute. The width is determined by summing the widths of the
   contained characters, adjusted for any indents, letter spacing, word spacing, or
   line-end conditions.
• For an ILSE that contains an illustration or table, the content rectangle is deter-
   mined from the bounding box of all graphics objects in the content, taking into
   account any explicit bounding boxes (such as the BBox entry in a form
   XObject). This implied size can be explicitly overridden by the element’s Width
   and Height attributes.
• For an ILSE that contains a mixture of elements, the height of the content rec-
   tangle is determined by aligning the child objects relative to one another based
   on their text baseline (for text ILSEs) or end edge (for nontext ILSEs), along
   with any applicable BaselineShift attribute (for all ILSEs), and then ﬁnding the
   extreme top and bottom for all elements.
   Note: Some applications may apply this process to all elements within the block;
   others may apply it on a line-by-line basis.
The allocation rectangle is derived from the content rectangle in a way that also
depends on the structure type:
• For a BLSE, the allocation rectangle is equal to the content rectangle with its
   before and after edges adjusted by the element’s SpaceBefore and SpaceAfter
   attributes, if any, but with no changes to the start and end edges.
• For an ILSE, the allocation rectangle is the same as the content rectangle.
Note: Future versions of Tagged PDF are likely to include additional attributes that
can adjust all four edges of the allocation rectangle for both BLSEs and ILSEs.
Illustration Attributes
Certain additional restrictions arise in connection with particular uses of illustra-
tion elements (structure types Figure, Formula, or Form):
• When an illustration element has a Placement attribute of Block, it must have a
   Height attribute with an explicitly speciﬁed numerical value (not Auto). This
   value is the sole source of information about the illustration’s extent in the
   block-progression direction.
• When an illustration element has a Placement attribute of Inline, it must have a
   Width attribute with an explicitly speciﬁed numerical value (not Auto). This
   value is the sole source of information about the illustration’s extent in the
   inline-progression direction.
• When an illustration element has a Placement attribute of Inline, Start, or End,
   the value of its BaselineShift attribute is used to determine the position of its
   after edge relative to the text baseline; BaselineShift is ignored for all other
   values of Placement. (An illustration element with a Placement value of Start
   can be used to create a dropped capital; one with a Placement value of Inline
   can be used to create a raised capital.)
List Attribute
The ListNumbering attribute, described in Table 9.30, is carried by an L (List)
element, but controls the interpretation of the Lbl (Label) elements within the
list’s LI (List item) elements (see “List Elements” on page 630). This attribute is
         deﬁned in attribute objects whose O (owner) entry has the value List (or is one of
         the format-speciﬁc owner names listed in Table 9.25 on page 639).

         Note: This attribute is used to allow a content extraction tool to autonumber a list.
         However, the Lbl elements within the table should nevertheless contain the resulting
         numbers explicitly, so that the document can be reﬂowed or printed without the need
         for autonumbering.
         Table Attributes
         The attributes described in Table 9.31 apply only to table cells (structure types TH
         and TD; see “Table Elements” on page 631). Attributes in this category are deﬁned
        in attribute objects whose O (owner) entry has the value Table (or is one of the
        format-speciﬁc owner names listed in Table 9.25 on page 639).

    9.8 Accessibility Support
        PDF includes several facilities in support of accessibility of documents to disabled
        users. In particular, many visually impaired computer users use screen readers to
        read documents aloud. To enable proper vocalization, either through a screen
        reader or by some more direct invocation of a text-to-speech engine, PDF sup-
        ports the following features:
        • Specifying the natural language used for text in a PDF document—for example,
          as English or Spanish (see Section 9.8.1, “Natural Language Speciﬁcation”)
        • Providing textual descriptions for images or other items that do not translate
          naturally into text (Section 9.8.2, “Alternate Descriptions”), or replacement
          text for content that does translate into text but is represented in a nonstandard
          way (such as with a ligature or illuminated character; see Section 9.8.3,
          “Replacement Text”)
        • Specifying the expansion of abbreviations or acronyms (Section 9.8.4, “Expan-
          sion of Abbreviations and Acronyms”)
        The core of this support lies in the ability to determine the logical order of con-
        tent in a PDF document, independently of the content’s appearance or layout,
        through logical structure and Tagged PDF, as described under “Page Content
        Order” on page 618. An accessibility application can extract the content of a doc-
        ument for presentation to a disabled user by traversing the structure hierarchy
        and presenting the contents of each node. For this reason, producers of PDF ﬁles
      must ensure that all information in a document is reachable via the structure
      hierarchy, and they are strongly encouraged to use the facilities described in this
      section.
      Note: Text can be extracted and examined or reused for purposes other than accessi-
      bility; see Section 9.7, “Tagged PDF.”
      Additional guidelines for accessibility support of content published on the World
      Wide Web can be found in the World Wide Web Consortium document Web Con-
      tent Accessibility Guidelines and the documents it points to (see the Bibliography).
9.8.1 Natural Language Speciﬁcation
      The natural language used for text in a document is determined in a hierarchical
      fashion, based on whether an optional Lang entry (PDF 1.4) is present in any of
      several possible locations. At the highest level, the document’s default language
      (which applies to both text strings and text within content streams) can be speci-
      ﬁed by a Lang entry in the document catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Cat-
      alog”). Below this, the language can be speciﬁed for the following:
      • Structure elements of any type (see Section 9.6.1, “Structure Hierarchy”),
        through a Lang entry in the structure element dictionary.
      • Marked-content sequences that are not in the structure hierarchy (see Section
        9.5, “Marked Content”), through a Lang entry in a property list attached to the
        marked-content sequence with a Span tag. (Note that although Span is also a
        standard structure type, as described under “Inline-Level Structure Elements”
        on page 632, its use here is entirely independent of logical structure.)
      The following sections provide details on the value of the Lang entry and the
      hierarchical manner in which the language for text in a document is determined.
      Note: Text strings encoded in Unicode may include an escape sequence indicating
      the language of the text, overriding the prevailing Lang entry (see Section 3.8.1,
      “Text Strings”).
      Language Identiﬁers
      The value of the Lang entry in the document catalog, structure element diction-
      ary, or property list is a text string that speciﬁes the language with a language
identiﬁer having the syntax deﬁned in Internet RFC 1766, Tags for the Identiﬁca-
tion of Languages. This syntax, which is summarized below, is also used to identify
languages in XML, according to the World Wide Web Consortium document
Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0; see the Bibliography for more infor-
mation about these documents. An empty string indicates that the language is
unknown.
Language identiﬁers can be based on codes deﬁned by the International Organi-
zation for Standardization in ISO 639 and ISO 3166 (see the Bibliography) or
registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA, whose Web site
is located at <http://iana.org/>), or they can include codes created for private
use. A language identiﬁer consists of a primary code optionally followed by one
or more subcodes (each preceded by a hyphen). The primary code can be any of
the following:
• A 2-character ISO 639 language code—for example, en for English or es for
   Spanish
• The letter i, designating an IANA-registered identiﬁer
• The letter x, for private use
The ﬁrst subcode can be a 2-character ISO 3166 country code, as in en-US, or a
3- to 8-character subcode registered with IANA, as in en-cockney or i-cherokee
(except in private identiﬁers, for which subcodes are not registered). Subcodes
beyond the ﬁrst can be any that have been registered with IANA.
Language Speciﬁcation Hierarchy
The Lang entry in the document catalog speciﬁes the natural language for all text
in the document except where overridden by language speciﬁcations for structure
elements or for marked-content sequences that are not in the structure hierarchy
(for example, within an entirely unstructured document). Examples in this sec-
tion illustrate the hierarchical manner in which the language for text in a docu-
ment is determined.
Example 9.16 shows how a language speciﬁed for the document as a whole could
be overridden by one speciﬁed for a marked-content sequence within a page’s
content stream, independent of any logical structure. In this case, the Lang entry
in the document catalog (not shown) has the value en-US, meaning U.S. English,
and it is overridden by the Lang property attached (with the Span tag) to the
marked-content sequence Hasta la vista. The Lang property identiﬁes the lan-
guage for this marked content sequence with the value es-MX, meaning Mexican
Spanish.
Example 9.16
   2 0 obj                                  % Page object
       << /Type /Page
           /Contents 3 0 R                  % Content stream
           …
       >>
   endobj
   3 0 obj                                  % Page's content stream
       << /Length … >>
   stream
       BT
          (See you later, or as Arnold would say, ) Tj
          /Span << /Lang (es-MX) >>         % Start of marked-content sequence
             BDC
                (Hasta la vista.) Tj
             EMC                            % End of marked-content sequence
       ET
   endstream
   endobj
Where logical structure is described (by a structure hierarchy) within a docu-
ment, the Lang entry in the document catalog sets the default for the document,
as usual; below that, any language speciﬁcations within the structure hierarchy
apply in this order:
• A structure element’s language speciﬁcation
• Within a structure element, a language speciﬁcation for a nested structure ele-
   ment or marked-content sequence
In Example 9.17, the Lang entry in the structure element dictionary (specifying
English) applies to the marked-content sequence having an MCID (marked-
content identiﬁer) value of 0 within the indicated page’s content stream. How-
ever, nested within that marked-content sequence is another one in which the
Lang property attached with the Span tag (specifying Spanish) overrides the
structure element’s language speciﬁcation.
Note: This example and the next one below omit required StructParents entries in
the objects used as content items (see “Finding Structure Elements from Content
Items” on page 600).
Example 9.17
   1 0 obj                                     % Structure element
       << /Type /StructElem
           /S /P                               % Structure type

If only part of the page content is contained in the structure hierarchy, and the
structured content is nested within nonstructured content to which a different
language speciﬁcation applies, the structure element’s language speciﬁcation
takes precedence. In Example 9.18, the page’s content stream consists of a
marked-content sequence that speciﬁes (via the Span tag with a Lang property)
Spanish as its language, but nested within it is content that is part of a structure
element (indicated by the MCID entry in that property list), and the language
speciﬁcation that applies to the latter content is that of the structure element,
English.

      In other words, a language identiﬁer attached to a marked-content sequence with
      the Span tag speciﬁes the language for all text in the sequence except for nested
      marked content that is contained in the structure hierarchy (in which case the
      structure element’s language applies) and except where overridden by language
      speciﬁcations for other nested marked content.
9.8.2 Alternate Descriptions
      PDF documents can be enhanced by providing alternate descriptions (as human-
      readable text) for images, formulas, or other items that do not translate naturally
      into text. A text-to-speech engine, for example, could vocalize the text of the al-
      ternate description for visually impaired users.
      An alternate description can be speciﬁed for the following:
      • A structure element (see Section 9.6.1, “Structure Hierarchy”), through an Alt
         entry in the structure element dictionary
      • Any type of annotation (see Section 8.4, “Annotations”) that does not already
         have a text representation, through a Contents entry in the annotation dic-
         tionary
      For annotation types that normally display text, that text (speciﬁed in the
      Contents entry of the annotation dictionary) is the natural source for vocaliza-
      tion purposes. For annotation types that do not display text, a Contents entry
      (PDF 1.4) may optionally be included to specify an alternate description. Sound
      annotations, which are vocalized by default and so need no alternate description
      for that purpose, may include a Contents entry specifying a description that will
      be displayed in a pop-up window for the beneﬁt of hearing-impaired users.
      In addition, an alternate name can be speciﬁed for an interactive form ﬁeld (see
      Section 8.6, “Interactive Forms”), to be used in place of the actual ﬁeld name
      wherever the ﬁeld must be identiﬁed in the user interface (such as in error or sta-
      tus messages referring to the ﬁeld). This alternate name, speciﬁed in the optional
      TU entry of the ﬁeld dictionary, can be useful for vocalization purposes.
      The following are true of all alternate descriptions (or ﬁeld names):
      • They are text strings, which may be encoded in either PDFDocEncoding or Uni-
         code character encoding. As described in Section 3.8.1, “Text Strings,” Unicode
         deﬁnes an escape sequence for indicating the language of the text; this mecha-
         nism enables the alternate description to change from the language speciﬁed by
         the prevailing Lang entry (as described in the preceding section).
      • The text is considered to be a word or phrase substitution for the current struc-
         ture element. For example, if each of two (or more) elements in a sequence has
         an Alt entry in its dictionary, they should be treated as if a word break is present
         between them.
9.8.3 Replacement Text
      Just as alternate descriptions can be provided for images and other items that do
      not translate naturally into text (as described in the preceding section), replace-
      ment text can be speciﬁed for content that does translate into text but that is rep-
      resented in a nonstandard way. These nonstandard representations might
      include, for example, glyphs for ligatures or custom characters, or inline graphics
      corresponding to letters in an illuminated manuscript or to dropped capitals.
      Replacement text can be speciﬁed for a structure element (see Section 9.6.1,
      “Structure Hierarchy”), in the optional ActualText entry (PDF 1.4) of the struc-
      ture element dictionary. The ActualText value is not a description but a replace-
      ment for the content, providing text that is equivalent to what a sighted reader
      would see when viewing the content. In contrast to the value of Alt, which is con-
      sidered to be a word or phrase substitution for the structure element, the value of
      ActualText is considered to be a character substitution for the structure element.
      Thus, if each of two (or more) elements in a sequence has an ActualText entry in
      its dictionary, they should be treated as if no word break is present between them.
      Like alternate descriptions (and other text strings), replacement text, if encoded
      in Unicode, may include an escape sequence for indicating the language of the
      text, overriding the prevailing Lang entry (see Section 3.8.1, “Text Strings”).
9.8.4 Expansion of Abbreviations and Acronyms
      Abbreviations and acronyms can pose a problem for text-to-speech engines.
      Sometimes the full pronunciation for an abbreviation can be divined without
      aid; for instance, a search through a dictionary will probably reveal that “Blvd.” is
      pronounced “boulevard” and that “Ave.” is pronounced “avenue.” However, some
      abbreviations are difﬁcult to resolve, as in the sentence “Dr. Healwell works at 123
      Industrial Dr.” For this reason, the expansion of an abbreviation or acronym can
    be supplied through an E property (PDF 1.4) attached to a marked-content
    sequence with a Span tag. For example:
        BT
           /Span << /E (Doctor) >>
              BDC
                 (Dr. ) Tj
              EMC
           (Healwell works at 123 Industrial ) Tj
           /Span << /E (Drive) >>
              BDC
                 (Dr.) Tj
              EMC
        ET
    The E value (a text string) is considered to be a word or phrase substitution for
    the tagged text and so should be treated as if a word break separates it from any
    surrounding text. Like other text strings, the expansion text, if encoded in Uni-
    code, may include an escape sequence for indicating the language of the text (see
    Section 3.8.1, “Text Strings”).
    Some abbreviations or acronyms are conventionally not expanded into words.
    For the text “CBS,” for example, either no expansion should be supplied (leaving
    its pronunciation up to the text-to-speech engine) or, to be safe, the expansion
    “C B S” should be speciﬁed.
9.9 Web Capture
    Web Capture is a PDF 1.3 feature that allows information from Internet-based or
    locally resident HTML, PDF, GIF, JPEG, and ASCII text ﬁles to be imported into
    a PDF ﬁle. This feature is implemented in Acrobat 4.0 and later viewers by a Web
    Capture plug-in extension (sometimes called AcroSpider). The information in
    the Web Capture data structures enables viewer applications to perform the fol-
    lowing operations:
    • Save locally and preserve the visual appearance of material from the World
       Wide Web
    • Retrieve additional material from the Web and add it to an existing PDF ﬁle
    • Update or modify existing material previously captured from the Web
          • Find source information for material captured from the Web, such as the URL
             (if any) from which it was captured
          • Find all material in a PDF ﬁle that was generated from a given URL
          • Find all material in a PDF ﬁle that matches a given digital identiﬁer (MD5
             hash)
          The information needed to perform these operations is recorded in two data
          structures in the PDF ﬁle:
          • The Web Capture information dictionary holds document-level information
             related to Web Capture.
          • The Web Capture content database keeps track of the material retrieved by Web
             Capture and where it came from, enabling Web Capture to avoid needlessly
             downloading material that is already present in the ﬁle.
          The following sections provide a detailed overview of these structures. See
          Appendix C for information about implementation limits in Web Capture.
          Note: The following discussion centers on HTML and GIF ﬁles, although Web Cap-
          ture handles other ﬁle types as well.
  9.9.1 Web Capture Information Dictionary
          The optional SpiderInfo entry in the document catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Docu-
          ment Catalog”) holds an optional Web Capture information dictionary containing
          document-level information related to Web Capture. Table 9.32 shows the con-
          tents of this dictionary.
                        TABLE 9.32 Entries in the Web Capture information dictionary
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE
V                                       number                                                      (Required) The Web Capture version number. For PDF 1.3, the version number is 1.0.
                                                                                                    Note: This value is a single real number, not a major and minor version number. Thus, for
                                                                                                    example, a version number of 1.2 would be considered greater than 1.15.

                                                                                                    “Command Dictionaries” on page 672) describing commands that were used in building
                                                                                                    the PDF ﬁle. The commands appear in the array in the order in which they were executed
                                                                                                    in building the ﬁle.
9.9.2 Content Database
      Web Capture retrieves HTML ﬁles from URLs and converts them into PDF. The
      resulting PDF ﬁle may contain the contents of multiple HTML pages. Conversely,
      since HTML pages do not have a ﬁxed size, a single HTML page may give rise to
      multiple PDF pages. To keep track of the correspondences, Web Capture main-
      tains a content database mapping URLs and digital identiﬁers to PDF objects such
      as pages and XObjects. By looking up digital identiﬁers in the database, Web Cap-
      ture can determine whether newly downloaded content is identical to content
      already retrieved from a different URL. This allows it to perform optimizations
      such as storing only one copy of an image that is referenced by multiple HTML
      pages.
      Web Capture’s content database is organized into content sets. Each content set is
      a dictionary holding information about a group of related PDF objects generated
      from the same source data. Content sets are of two subtypes: page sets and image
      sets. When Web Capture converts an HTML ﬁle into PDF pages, for example, it
      creates a page set to hold information about the pages. Similarly, when it converts
      a GIF image into one or more image XObjects, it creates an image set describing
      those XObjects.
      The content set corresponding to a given data source can be accessed in either of
      two ways:
      • By the URLs from which it was retrieved
      • By a digital identiﬁer generated from the source data itself (see “Digital Identi-
        ﬁers” on page 664)
      The URLS and IDS entries in a PDF document’s name dictionary (see Section
      3.6.3, “Name Dictionary”) contain name trees mapping URLs and digital identi-
      ﬁers, respectively, to Web Capture content sets. Figure 9.1 shows a simple exam-
      ple. An HTML ﬁle retrieved from the URL <http://www.adobe.com/> has been
      converted into three pages in the PDF ﬁle. The entry for that URL in the URLS
      name tree points to a page set containing the three pages. Similarly, the IDS name
      tree contains an entry pointing to the same page set, associated with the digital
      identiﬁer calculated from the HTML source (the string shown in the ﬁgure as
      904B…1EA2).

Entries in the URLS and IDS name trees may refer to an array of content sets
instead of just a single content set. The content sets need not have the same sub-
type, but may include both page sets and image sets. In Figure 9.2, for example, a
GIF ﬁle has been retrieved from a URL (<http://www.adobe.com/getacro.gif>)
and converted into a single PDF page. As in Figure 9.1, a page set has been created
to hold information about the new page. However, since the retrieval also
resulted in a new image XObject, an image set has also been created. Instead of
pointing directly to a single content set, the URLS and IDS entries point to an
array containing both the page set and the image set.

                     FIGURE 9.2 Complex Web Capture ﬁle structure
URL Strings
URLs associated with Web Capture content sets must be reduced to a predictable,
canonical form before being used as keys in the URLS name tree. The following
steps describe how to perform this reduction, using terminology from Internet
RFCs 1738, Uniform Resource Locators, and 1808, Relative Uniform Resource Loca-
tors (see the Bibliography). This algorithm is relevant for HTTP, FTP, and ﬁle
URLs:
1. If the URL is relative, make it absolute.
2. If the URL contains one or more number sign characters ( # ), strip the left-
   most number sign and any characters after it.
3. Convert the scheme section to lowercase ASCII.
4. If there is a host section, convert it to lowercase ASCII.
5. If the scheme is ﬁle and the host is localhost, strip the host section.
6. If there is a port section and the port is the default port for the given protocol
   (80 for HTTP or 21 for FTP), strip the port section.
7. If the path section contains dot ( . ) or double-dot ( .. ) subsequences, transform
   the path as described in section 4 of RFC 1808.
Note: Because the percent character ( % ) is “unsafe” according to RFC 1738 and is
also the escape character for encoded characters, it is not possible in general to distin-
guish a URL with unencoded characters from one with encoded characters. For
example, it is impossible to decide whether the sequence %00 represents a single
encoded null character or a sequence of three unencoded characters. Hence no num-
ber of encoding or decoding passes on a URL will ever cause it to reach a stable state.
Empirically, URLs embedded in HTML ﬁles have unsafe characters encoded with
one encoding pass, and Web servers perform one decoding pass on received paths
(though CGI scripts are free to make their own decisions). Canonical URLs are thus
assumed to have undergone one and only one encoding pass. A URL whose initial
encoding state is known can be safely transformed into a URL that has undergone
only one encoding pass.
Digital Identiﬁers
Digital identiﬁers associated with Web Capture content sets by the IDS name tree
are generated using the MD5 message-digest algorithm (described in Internet
RFC 1321, The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm; see the Bibliography). The exact
data passed to the algorithm depends on the type of content set and the nature of
the identiﬁer being calculated.
For a page set, the source data itself is passed to the MD5 algorithm ﬁrst, followed
by strings representing the digital identiﬁers of any auxiliary data ﬁles (such as
images) referenced in the source data, in the order in which they are ﬁrst refer-
enced. (If an auxiliary ﬁle is referenced more than once, its identiﬁer is passed
only the ﬁrst time.) This produces a composite identiﬁer representing the visual
appearance of the pages in the page set. Two HTML source ﬁles that are identical,
but for which the referenced images contain different data—for example, if they
have been generated by a script or are pointed to by relative URLs—will not pro-
duce the same identiﬁer.
Note: When the source data is taken from a PDF ﬁle, the identiﬁer will be generated
solely from the contents of that ﬁle; there is no auxiliary data. (See also implementa-
tion note 107 in Appendix H.)
A page set can also have a text identiﬁer, calculated by applying the MD5 algo-
rithm to just the rendered text present in the source data. For an HTML ﬁle, for
example, the text identiﬁer is based solely on the text between markup tags; no
images are used in the calculation.
For an image set, the digital identiﬁer is calculated by passing the source data for
the original image to the MD5 algorithm. For example, the identiﬁer for an
image set created from a GIF image is calculated from the contents of the GIF
itself.
Unique Name Generation
In generating PDF pages from a data source, Web Capture converts items such as
hypertext links and HTML form ﬁelds into corresponding named destinations
and interactive form ﬁelds. These items must have names that do not conﬂict
with those of existing items in the ﬁle. Also, when updating the ﬁle, Web Capture
may need to locate all destinations and ﬁelds constructed for a given page set.
Accordingly, each destination or ﬁeld is given a unique name, derived from its
original name but constructed so as to avoid conﬂicts with similarly named items
in other page sets.
Note: As used here, the term name refers to a string, not a name object.
The unique name is formed by appending an encoded form of the page set’s digi-
tal identiﬁer string to the original name of the destination or ﬁeld. The identiﬁer
string must be encoded to remove characters that have special meaning in desti-
nations and ﬁelds. For example, since the period character ( . ) is used as the ﬁeld
separator in interactive form ﬁeld names, it must not appear in the identiﬁer por-
tion of the unique name; it is therefore encoded internally as two bytes, 92 and
112, corresponding to the ASCII characters \p . Note that since the backslash
character ( \ ) has special meaning for the syntax of string objects, it must be pre-
ceded by another backslash when written in the PDF ﬁle. For example, if the orig-
inal digital identiﬁer string were
    alpha.beta
this would be encoded internally as
    alpha\pbeta
and written in the PDF ﬁle as
    (alpha\\pbeta)
Similarly, the null character (character code 0) is encoded internally as the two
bytes 92 and 48, corresponding to the ASCII characters \0. If the original digital
identiﬁer string were
    alphaØbeta
(where Ø denotes the null character), it would be encoded internally as
    alpha\0beta
and written in the PDF ﬁle as
    (alpha\\0beta)
Finally, the backslash character itself is encoded internally as the two bytes 92 and
92, corresponding to the characters \\. In written form, each of these in turn
requires a preceding backslash. Thus the digital identiﬁer string
    alpha\beta
      would be encoded internally as
          alpha\\beta
      and written in the PDF ﬁle as
          (alpha\\\\beta)
      If the name is used for an interactive form ﬁeld, there is an additional encoding to
      ensure uniqueness and compatibility with interactive forms. Each byte in the
      source string, encoded as described above, is replaced by two bytes in the destina-
      tion string. The ﬁrst byte in each pair is 65 (corresponding to the ASCII character
      A) plus the high-order 4 bits of the source byte; the second byte is 65 plus the
      low-order 4 bits of the source byte.
9.9.3 Content Sets
      A Web Capture content set is a dictionary describing a set of PDF objects gener-
      ated from the same source data. It may include information common to all the
      objects in the set as well as about the set itself. Table 9.33 shows the contents of
      this type of dictionary.
      Page Sets
      A page set is a content set containing a group of PDF page objects generated from
      a common source, such as an HTML ﬁle. The pages are listed in the O array (see
      Table 9.33) in the same order in which they were initially added to the ﬁle. A
      single page object may not belong to more than one page set. Table 9.34 shows
      the content set dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of content set.
      The optional TID (text identiﬁer) entry may be used to store an identiﬁer gener-
      ated from the text of the pages belonging to the page set (see “Digital Identiﬁ-
      ers” on page 664). This identiﬁer may be used, for example, to determine
      whether the text of a document has changed. A text identiﬁer may not be
      appropriate for some page sets (such as those with no text), and should be
      omitted in these cases.

         Image Sets
         An image set is a content set containing a group of image XObjects generated
         from a common source, such as multiple frames of an animated GIF image. (Web
         Capture 4.0 will always generate a single image XObject for a given image.) A
         single XObject may not belong to more than one image set. Table 9.35 shows the
         content set dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of content set.

                                                                                                    reference count for that XObject. If the image set contains multiple XObjects, the value is
                                                                                                    an array of reference counts parallel to the O array (see Table 9.33 on page 668); that is,
                                                                                                    each element in the R array holds the reference count for the image XObject at the corre-

         Each image XObject in an image set has a reference count indicating the number
         of PDF pages referring to that XObject. The reference count is incremented
         whenever Web Capture creates a new page referring to the XObject (including
         copies of already existing pages) and decremented whenever such a page is
         destroyed. (The reference count is incremented or decremented only once per
         page, regardless of the number of times the XObject may be referenced by that
         same page.) When the reference count reaches 0, it is assumed that there are no
         remaining pages referring to the XObject, and that it can be removed from the
         image set’s O array. (See implementation note 108 in Appendix H.)
  9.9.4 Source Information
         The SI entry in a content set dictionary (see Table 9.33 on page 668) identiﬁes one
         or more source information dictionaries containing information about the loca-
         tions from which the source data for the content set was retrieved. Table 9.36

      In the simplest case, the content set’s SI entry just contains a single source infor-
      mation dictionary. However, it is not uncommon for the same source data to be
      accessible via two or more unrelated URLs. When Web Capture detects such a
      condition (by comparing digital identiﬁers), it generates a single content set from
      the source data, containing just one copy of the relevant PDF pages or image
      XObjects, but creates multiple source information dictionaries describing the
      separate ways in which the original source data can be accessed. It then stores an
      array containing these multiple source information dictionaries as the value of
      the SI entry in the content set dictionary.
      A source information dictionary’s AU (aliased URLs) entry identiﬁes the URLs
      from which the source data was retrieved. If there is only one such URL, a simple
      string sufﬁces as the value of this entry. If multiple URLs map to the same loca-
      tion through redirection, the AU value is a URL alias dictionary representing
      them (see “URL Alias Dictionaries,” below).
      Note: For ﬁle size efﬁciency, it is recommended that the entire URL alias dictionary
      (excluding the URL strings) be represented as a direct object, as its internal structure
      should never be shared or externally referenced.
      The TS (time stamp) entry allows each source location associated with a content
      set to have its own time stamp. This is necessary because the time stamp in the
      content set dictionary itself (see Table 9.33 on page 668) merely refers to the cre-
      ation date of the content set. A hypothetical “Update Content Set” command
      might reset the time stamp in the source information dictionary to the current
      time if it found the that the source data had not changed since the time stamp
      was last set.
      The E (expiration) entry speciﬁes an expiration date for each source location
      associated with a content set. If the current date and time are later than those
      speciﬁed, the contents of the content set should be considered out of date with
      the original source.
      URL Alias Dictionaries
      When a URL is accessed via HTTP, a response header may be returned indicat-
      ing that the requested data is to be found at a different URL. This redirection
      process may be repeated in turn at the new URL, and can potentially continue
      indeﬁnitely. It is not uncommon to ﬁnd multiple URLs that all lead eventually to
      the same destination through one or more redirections. A URL alias dictionary
      represents such a set of URL chains leading to a common destination. Table 9.37
      shows the contents of this type of dictionary.
                             TABLE 9.37 Entries in a URL alias dictionary
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE
U                                       string                                                      (Required) The destination URL to which all of the chains speciﬁed by the C entry lead.
C                                       array                                                       (Optional) An array of one or more arrays of strings, each representing a chain of URLs
                                                                                                    leading to the common destination speciﬁed by U.
      The C (chains) entry should be omitted if the URL alias dictionary contains only
      one URL. If C is present, its value is an array of arrays, each representing a chain
      of URLs leading to the common destination. Within each chain, the URLs are
      stored as strings in the order in which they occur in the redirection sequence. The
      common destination (the last URL in a chain) may be omitted, since it is already
      identiﬁed by the U entry. (See implementation note 109 in Appendix H.)
      Command Dictionaries
      A Web Capture command dictionary represents a command executed by Web
      Capture to retrieve one or more pieces of source data that were used to create
      new pages or modify existing pages. The entries in this dictionary represent
      parameters that were originally speciﬁed interactively by the user who requested
      that the Web content be captured. This information is recorded so that the com-
      mand can subsequently be repeated to update the captured content. Table 9.38
      shows the contents of this type of dictionary.
                     TABLE 9.38 Entries in a Web Capture command dictionary
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE

                                                                                                    value: 1.

                                                                                                    Table 9.39). Default value: 0.

H                                       string                                                      (Optional) Additional HTTP request headers sent to the URL.
S                                       dictionary                                                  (Optional) A command settings dictionary containing settings used in the con-
                                                                                                    version process (see “Command Settings” on page 674).
      The URL entry speciﬁes the initial URL for the retrieval command. The L (levels)
      entry speciﬁes the number of levels of pages requested to be retrieved from this
      URL. If the L entry is omitted, its value is assumed to be 1, denoting retrieval of
      the initial URL only.
      The value of the command dictionary’s F entry is an unsigned 32-bit integer con-
      taining ﬂags specifying various characteristics of the command. Bit positions
           within the ﬂag word are numbered from 1 (low-order) to 32 (high-order). Table
           9.39 shows the meanings of the ﬂags; all undeﬁned ﬂag bits are reserved and must
           be set to 0.
                                  TABLE 9.39 Web Capture command ﬂags
BIT POSITION      NAME             MEANING
      1           SameSite         If set, pages were retrieved only from the host speciﬁed in the initial URL.
      2           SamePath         If set, pages were retrieved only from the path speciﬁed in the initial URL (see
                                   below).
      3           Submit           If set, the command represents a form submission (see below).
           The SamePath ﬂag, if set, indicates that pages were retrieved only if they were in
           the same path speciﬁed in the initial URL. A page is considered to be in the same
           path if its scheme and network location components (as deﬁned in Internet RFC
           1808, Relative Uniform Resource Locators) match those of the initial URL and its
           path component matches up to and including the last forward slash ( / ) character
           in the initial URL. For example, the URL
               http://www.adobe.com/ﬁddle/faddle/foo.html
           is considered to be in the same path as the initial URL
               http://www.adobe.com/ﬁddle/initial.html
           The comparison is case-insensitive for the scheme and network location compo-
           nents and case-sensitive for the path component.
           If the Submit ﬂag is set, the command represents a form submission. If no P
           (posted data) entry is present, the submitted data is encoded in the URL (an
           HTTP GET request). If P is present, the command represents an HTTP POST
           request. In this case, the value of the Submit ﬂag is ignored. If the posted data is
           small enough, it may be represented by a string; for large amounts of data, a
           stream is recommended, as it can offer compression.
           The CT (content type) entry is relevant only for POST requests. It describes the
           content type of the posted data, as described in Internet RFC 2045, Multipurpose
       Internet Mail Extensions (MIME), Part One: Format of Internet Message Bodies
       (see the Bibliography).
       The H (headers) entry speciﬁes additional HTTP request headers that were sent
       in the request for the URL. Each header line in the string is terminated with a car-
       riage return and a line feed. For example:
          (Referer: http://frumble.com\015\012From:veeble@frotz.com\015\012)
       The HTTP request header format is speciﬁed in Internet RFC 2068, Hypertext
       Transfer Protocol—HTTP/1.1 (see the Bibliography).
       The S (settings) entry speciﬁes a command settings dictionary (see the next sec-
       tion). holding settings speciﬁc to the conversion engines. If this entry is omitted,
       default values are assumed. It is recommended that command settings diction-
       aries be shared by any command dictionaries that use the same settings.
       Command Settings
       The S (settings) entry in a command dictionary contains a command settings
       dictionary, which holds settings for conversion engines used in converting the
       results of the command to PDF. Table 9.40 shows the contents of this type of dic-
       tionary.
                  TABLE 9.40 Entries in a Web Capture command settings dictionary
KEY                                     TYPE                                                        VALUE
G                                       dictionary                                                  (Optional) A dictionary containing global conversion engine settings relevant to all con-
                                                                                                    version engines. If this key is absent, default settings will be used.
C                                       dictionary                                                  (Optional) Settings for speciﬁc conversion engines. Each key in this dictionary is the
                                                                                                    internal name of a conversion engine (see below). The associated value is a dictionary
                                                                                                    containing the settings associated with that conversion engine. If the settings for a par-
                                                                                                    ticular conversion engine are not found in the dictionary, default settings will be used.
       Each key in the C dictionary is the internal name of a conversion engine, which
       should be a name object of the following form:
          /company:product:version:contentType
      where
        company is the name (or abbreviation) of the company that created the conver-
        sion engine.
        product is the name of the conversion engine. This ﬁeld may be left blank, but
        the trailing colon character ( : ) is still required.
        version is the version of the conversion engine.
        contentType is an identiﬁer for the content type that the settings are associated
        with. This is required because some converters may handle multiple content
        types.
      For example:
         /ADBE:H2PDF:1.0:HTML
      Note that all ﬁelds in the internal name are case-sensitive. The company ﬁeld
      must conform to the naming guidelines described in Appendix E; the values of
      the other ﬁelds are unrestricted, except that they must not contain a colon.
      Note: It must be possible to make a deep copy of a command settings dictionary
      without explicit knowledge of the settings it may contain. To facilitate this operation,
      the directed graph of PDF objects rooted by the command settings dictionary must be
      entirely self-contained; that is, it must not contain any object referred to from else-
      where in the PDF ﬁle.
9.9.5 Object Attributes Related to Web Capture
      A given page object or image XObject can belong to at most one Web Capture
      content set, called its parent content set. However, the object has no direct pointer
      to its parent content set; such a pointer might present problems for an appli-
      cation that traces all pointers from an object to determine, for example, what
      resources the object depends on. Instead, the object’s ID entry (see Tables 3.18 on
      page 88 and 4.35 on page 267) contains the digital identiﬁer of the parent content
      set, which can be used to locate the parent content set via the IDS name tree in the
      document’s name dictionary. (If the IDS entry for the identiﬁer contains an array
      of content sets, the parent can be found by searching the array for the content set
      whose O entry includes the child object.)
       In the course of creating PDF pages from HTML ﬁles, Web Capture frequently
       scales the contents down to ﬁt on ﬁxed-sized pages. The PZ (preferred zoom)
       entry in a page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87) speciﬁes a magniﬁcation
       factor by which the page can be scaled to undo the downscaling and view the
       page at its original size. That is, when the page is viewed at the preferred magniﬁ-
       cation factor, one unit in default user space will correspond to one original
       source pixel.
 9.10 Prepress Support
       This section describes features of PDF that support prepress production work-
       ﬂows:
       • The speciﬁcation of page boundaries governing various aspects of the prepress
         process, such as cropping, bleed, and trimming (Section 9.10.1, “Page Bound-
         aries”)
       • Facilities for including printer’s marks such as registration targets, gray ramps,
         color bars, and cut marks to assist in the production process (Section 9.10.2,
         “Printer’s Marks”)
       • Information for generating color separations for pages in a document (Section
         9.10.3, “Separation Dictionaries”)
       • Output intents for matching the color characteristics of a document with those
         of a target output device or production environment in which it will be printed
         (Section 9.10.4, “Output Intents”)
       • Support for the generation of traps to minimize the visual effects of misregis-
         tration between multiple colorants (Section 9.10.5, “Trapping Support”)
       • The Open Prepress Interface (OPI) for creating low-resolution proxies for high-
         resolution images (Section 9.10.6, “Open Prepress Interface (OPI)”)
9.10.1 Page Boundaries
       A PDF page may be prepared either for a ﬁnished medium, such as a sheet of
       paper, or as part of a prepress process in which the content of the page is placed
       on an intermediate medium, such as ﬁlm or an imposed reproduction plate. In
       the latter case, it is important to distinguish between the intermediate page and
       the ﬁnished page. The intermediate page may often include additional
       production-related content, such as bleeds or printer marks, that falls outside the
boundaries of the ﬁnished page. To handle such cases, a PDF page can deﬁne as
many as ﬁve separate boundaries to control various aspects of the imaging
process:
• The media box deﬁnes the boundaries of the physical medium on which the
  page is to be printed. It may include any extended area surrounding the
  ﬁnished page for bleed, printing marks, or other such purposes. It may also
  include areas close to the edges of the medium that cannot be marked because
  of physical limitations of the output device. Content falling outside this boun-
  dary can safely be discarded without affecting the meaning of the PDF ﬁle.
• The crop box deﬁnes the region to which the contents of the page are to be
  clipped (cropped) when displayed or printed. Unlike the other boxes, the crop
  box has no deﬁned meaning in terms of physical page geometry or intended
  use; it merely imposes clipping on the page contents. However, in the absence
  of additional information (such as imposition instructions speciﬁed in a JDF
  or PJTF job ticket), the crop box will determine how the page’s contents are to
  be positioned on the output medium. The default value is the page’s media
  box.
• The bleed box (PDF 1.3) deﬁnes the region to which the contents of the page
  should be clipped when output in a production environment. This may include
  any extra “bleed area” needed to accommodate the physical limitations of cut-
  ting, folding, and trimming equipment. The actual printed page may include
  printing marks that fall outside the bleed box. The default value is the page’s
  crop box.
• The trim box (PDF 1.3) deﬁnes the intended dimensions of the ﬁnished page
  after trimming. It may be smaller than the media box, to allow for production-
  related content such as printing instructions, cut marks, or color bars. The
  default value is the page’s crop box.
• The art box (PDF 1.3) deﬁnes the extent of the page’s meaningful content
  (including potential white space) as intended by the page’s creator. The default
  value is the page’s crop box.
These boundaries are speciﬁed by the MediaBox, CropBox, BleedBox, TrimBox,
and ArtBox entries, respectively, in the page object dictionary (see Table 3.18 on
page 88). All of them are rectangles expressed in default user space units. The
crop, bleed, trim, and art boxes should not ordinarily extend beyond the boun-
daries of the media box; if they do, they will be effectively reduced to their inter-
section with the media box. Figure 9.3 illustrates the relationships among these
boundaries. (The crop box is not shown in the ﬁgure because it has no deﬁned
relationship with any of the other boundaries.)
                               Headline
                                                                      Art box
                                                                      Trim box
                         This might be a caption
                         Bleed: 10.75x8.25
                         Trim: 10.5x8
                    Printer’s marks
                                            Bleed box
         Media box
                               FIGURE 9.3 Page boundaries
How the various boundaries are used depends on the purpose to which the page
is being put. Typical purposes might include the following:
• Placing the content of a page in another application. The art box determines the
   boundary of the content that is to be placed in the application. Depending on
   the applicable usage conventions, the placed content may be clipped to either
   the art box or the bleed box. (For example, a quarter-page advertisement to be
   placed on a magazine page might be clipped to the art box on the two sides of
   the ad that face into the middle of the page and to the bleed box on the two
   sides that bleed over the edge of the page.) The media box and trim box are
   ignored.
• Printing a ﬁnished page. This case is typical of desktop or shared page printers,
   in which the page content is positioned directly on the ﬁnal output medium.
   The art box and bleed box are ignored. The media box may be used as advice
   for selecting media of the appropriate size. The crop box and trim box, if
   present, should be the same as the media box. (See implementation note 110 in
   Appendix H.)
• Printing an intermediate page for use in a prepress process. The art box is
   ignored. The bleed box deﬁnes the boundary of the content to be imaged. The
   trim box speciﬁes the positioning of the content on the medium; it may also be
   used to generate cut or fold marks outside the bleed box. Content falling within
   the media box but outside the bleed box may or may not be imaged, depending
   on the speciﬁc production process being used.
• Building an imposition of multiple pages on a press sheet. The art box is ignored.
   The bleed box deﬁnes the clipping boundary of the content to be imaged; con-
   tent outside the bleed box will be ignored. The trim box speciﬁes the position-
   ing of the page’s content within the imposition. Cut and fold marks are
   typically generated for the imposition as a whole.
In the scenarios above, an application that interprets the bleed, trim, and art
boxes for some purpose will typically alter the crop box so as to impose the clip-
ping that those boxes prescribe.
Display of Page Boundaries
For the user’s convenience, viewer applications may wish to offer the ability to
display guidelines on the screen for the various page boundaries. The optional
BoxColorInfo entry in a page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87) holds a box
       color information dictionary (PDF 1.4) specifying the colors and other visual char-
       acteristics to be used for such display. Viewer applications will typically provide a
       user interface to allow the user to set these characteristics interactively. Note that
       this information is page-speciﬁc and can vary from one page to another.
       As shown in Table 9.41, the box color information dictionary contains an optional
       entry for each of the possible page boundaries other than the media box; the value
       of each entry is in turn a box style dictionary, whose contents are shown in Table
       9.42. If a given entry is absent, the viewer application should use its own current
       default settings instead.
9.10.2 Printer’s Marks
       Printer’s marks are graphic symbols or text added to a page to assist production
       personnel in identifying components of a multiple-plate job and maintaining
       consistent output during production. Examples commonly used in the printing
       industry include:
       • Registration targets for aligning plates
       • Gray ramps and color bars for measuring colors and ink densities
       • Cut marks showing where the output medium is to be trimmed
       Although PDF producer applications traditionally include such marks in the con-
       tent stream of a document, they are logically separate from the content of the page
       itself and typically appear outside the boundaries (the crop box, trim box, and art
       box) deﬁning the extent of that content (see Section 9.10.1, “Page Boundaries”).
       Printer’s mark annotations (PDF 1.4) provide a mechanism for incorporating
       printer’s marks into the PDF representation of a page, while keeping them sepa-
       rate from the actual page content. Each page in a PDF document may contain any
       number of such annotations, each of which represents a single printer’s mark.
       Note: Because printer’s marks typically fall outside the page’s content boundaries,
       each mark must be represented as a separate annotation. Otherwise—if, for exam-
       ple, the cut marks at the four corners of the page were deﬁned in a single annota-
       tion—the annotation rectangle would encompass the entire contents of the page and
       could interfere with the user’s ability to select content or interact with other annota-
       tions on the page. Deﬁning printer’s marks in separate annotations also facilitates
       the implementation of a drag-and-drop user interface for specifying them.

        The visual presentation of a printer’s mark is deﬁned by a form XObject speciﬁed
        as an appearance stream in the N (normal) entry of the printer’s mark annota-
        tion’s appearance dictionary (see Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”). More
        than one appearance may be deﬁned for the same printer’s mark, to meet the
        requirements of different regions or production facilities; in this case, the
        appearance dictionary’s N entry holds a subdictionary containing the alternate
        appearances, each identiﬁed by an arbitrary key. The AS (appearance state) entry
        in the annotation dictionary designates one of them to be displayed or printed.
        Note: The printer’s mark annotation’s appearance dictionary may include R (roll-
        over) or D (down) entries, but appearances deﬁned in either of these entries will
        never be displayed or printed.
        Like all annotations, a printer’s mark annotation is deﬁned by an annotation dic-
        tionary (see Section 8.4.1, “Annotation Dictionaries”); its annotation type is
        PrinterMark. The AP (appearances) and F (ﬂags) entries (which ordinarily are
        optional) must be present, as must the AS (appearance state) entry if the appear-
        ance dictionary AP contains more than one appearance stream. The Print and
        ReadOnly ﬂags in the F entry must be set and all others clear (see Section 8.4.2,
        “Annotation Flags”). Table 9.43 shows an additional annotation dictionary entry
        speciﬁc to this type of annotation.

 9.10.3 Separation Dictionaries
          In high-end printing workﬂows, pages are ultimately produced as sets of separa-
          tions, one per colorant (see “Separation Color Spaces” on page 201). Ordinarily,
          each page in a PDF ﬁle is treated as a composite page that paints graphics objects
          using all the process colorants and perhaps some spot colorants as well. In other
          words, all separations for a page are generated from a single PDF description of
          that page.
          In some workﬂows, however, pages are pre-separated prior to the generation of
          the PDF ﬁle. In a pre-separated PDF ﬁle, the separations for a page are described
          as separate page objects, each painting only a single colorant (usually speciﬁed in
          the DeviceGray color space). When this is done, additional information is needed
          to identify the actual colorant associated with each separation and to group
          together the page objects representing all the separations for a given page. This
          information is contained in a separation dictionary (PDF 1.3) in the Separation-
          Info entry of each page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87). Table 9.45 shows
          the contents of this type of dictionary.

 9.10.4 Output Intents
          Output intents (PDF 1.4) provide a means for matching the color characteristics
          of a PDF document with those of a target output device or production environ-
          ment in which the document will be printed. The optional OutputIntents entry
          in the document catalog (see Section 3.6.1, “Document Catalog”) holds an array
          of output intent dictionaries, each describing the color reproduction characteris-
          tics of a possible output device or production condition. The contents of these
          dictionaries can vary for different devices and conditions; the dictionary’s S entry
          speciﬁes an output intent subtype that determines the format and meaning of the
          remaining entries.
          This use of multiple output intents allows the production process to be custom-
          ized to the expected workﬂow and the speciﬁc tools available. For example, one
          production facility might process ﬁles conforming to a recognized format stan-
          dard such as PDF/X-1, while another uses custom Acrobat plug-in extensions to
          produce RGB output for document distribution on the World Wide Web; each of
         these workﬂows would require different sets of output intent information. Multi-
         ple output intents also allow the same PDF ﬁle to be distributed unmodiﬁed to
         multiple production facilities. The choice of which output intent to use in a given
         production environment is a matter for agreement between the purchaser and
         provider of production services; PDF intentionally does not include a selector for
         choosing a particular output intent from within the PDF ﬁle itself.
         At the time of publication, only one output intent subtype, GTS_PDFX, has been
         deﬁned, corresponding to the PDF/X format standard (available on the World
         Wide Web at <http://www.npes.org/standards/>); Table 9.46 shows the contents
         of this type of output intent dictionary. Other subtypes may be added in the
         future; the names of any such additional subtypes must conform to the naming
         guidelines described in Appendix E.

                                                                                                    111 in Appendix H.)
          Note: PDF/X is actually a family of standards representing varying levels of con-
          formance. The standard for a given conformance level may prescribe further restric-
          tions on the usage and meaning of entries in the output intent dictionary. Any such
          restrictions take precedence over the descriptions given in Table 9.46.
          The ICC proﬁle information in an output intent dictionary supplements rather
          than replaces that in an ICCBased or default color space (see “ICCBased Color
          Spaces” on page 189 and “Default Color Spaces” on page 194). Those mecha-
          nisms are speciﬁcally intended for describing the characteristics of source color
          component values; an output intent can be used in conjunction with them to
          convert source colors to those required for a speciﬁc production condition or to
          enable the display or prooﬁng of the intended output.
          The data in an output intent dictionary is provided for informational purposes
          only, and PDF consumer applications are free to disregard it. In particular, there
          is no expectation that PDF production tools will automatically convert colors
          expressed in the same source color space to the speciﬁed target space before gen-
          erating output. (In some workﬂows, such conversion may, in fact, be undesirable.
          For example, when working with CMYK source colors tagged with a source ICC
proﬁle solely for purposes of characterization, converting such colors from four
components to three and back is unnecessary and will result in a loss of ﬁdelity in
the values of the black component; see “Implicit Conversion of CIE-Based Color
Spaces” on page 195 for further discussion.) On the other hand, when source
colors are expressed in different base color spaces—for example, when combin-
ing separately generated images on the same PDF page—it is possible (though
not required) to use the destination proﬁle speciﬁed in the output intent diction-
ary to convert source colors to the same target color space. (See implementation
note 112 in Appendix H.)

standard production condition (CGATS TR 001) from the ICC Characterization

9.10.5 Trapping Support
       On devices such as offset printing presses, which mark multiple colorants on a
       single sheet of physical medium, mechanical limitations of the device can cause
       imprecise alignment, or misregistration, between colorants. This can produce
       unwanted visual artifacts such as brightly colored gaps or bands around the edges
       of printed objects. In high-quality reproduction of color documents, such arti-
       facts are commonly avoided by creating an overlap, called a trap, between areas of
       adjacent color.
       Figure 9.4 shows an example of trapping. The light and medium grays represent
       two different colorants, which are used to paint the background and the glyph
       denoting the letter A. The ﬁrst ﬁgure shows the intended result, with the two
       colorants properly registered. The second ﬁgure shows what happens when the
       colorants are misregistered. In the third ﬁgure, traps have been overprinted along
       the boundaries, obscuring the artifacts caused by the misregistration. (For em-
       phasis, the traps are shown here in dark gray; in actual practice, their color would
       be similar to one of the adjoining colors.)

                                     FIGURE 9.4 Trapping example
Trapping can be implemented by the application generating a PDF ﬁle, by some
intermediate application that adds traps to a PDF document, or by the raster
image processor (RIP) that produces ﬁnal output. In the last two cases, the trap-
ping process is controlled by a set of trapping instructions, which deﬁne two kinds
of information:
• Trapping zones within which traps should be created
• Trapping parameters specifying the nature of the traps within each zone
Trapping zones and trapping parameters are discussed fully in Sections 6.3.2 and
6.3.3, respectively, of the PostScript Language Reference, Third Edition. Trapping
instructions are not directly speciﬁed in a PDF ﬁle (as they are in a PostScript
ﬁle); instead, they are speciﬁed in a job ticket that accompanies the PDF ﬁle or can
be embedded within it. Various standards exist for the format of job tickets; two
of them, JDF (Job Deﬁnition Format) and PJTF (Portable Job Ticket Format), are
described in the CIP4 document JDF Speciﬁcation and in Adobe Technical Note
#5620, Portable Job Ticket Format (see the Bibliography).
When trapping is performed before the production of ﬁnal output, the resulting
traps are placed in the PDF ﬁle for subsequent use. The traps themselves are
described as a content stream in a trap network annotation (see below). The
stream dictionary can include additional entries describing the method that was
used to produce the traps and other information about their appearance.
Trap Network Annotations
A complete set of traps generated for a given page under a speciﬁed set of trap-
ping instructions is called a trap network (PDF 1.3). It is a form XObject contain-
ing graphics objects for painting the required traps on the page. A page may have
more than one trap network based on different trapping instructions, presum-
ably intended for different output devices. All of the trap networks for a given
page are contained in a single trap network annotation (see Section 8.4, “Annota-
tions”). There can be at most one trap network annotation per page, which must
be the last element in the page’s Annots array (see “Page Objects” on page 87).
This ensures that the trap network is printed after all of the page’s other contents.
(See implementation note 113 in Appendix H.)
The form XObject deﬁning a trap network is speciﬁed as an appearance stream in
the N (normal) entry of the trap network annotation’s appearance dictionary (see
Section 8.4.4, “Appearance Streams”). If more than one trap network is deﬁned
for the same page, the N entry holds a subdictionary containing the alternate trap
networks, each identiﬁed by an arbitrary key. The AS (appearance state) entry in
the annotation dictionary designates one of them as the current trap network to
be displayed or printed.
Note: The trap network annotation’s appearance dictionary may include R (rollover)
or D (down) entries, but appearances deﬁned in either of these entries will never be
printed.
Like all annotations, a trap network annotation is deﬁned by an annotation dic-
tionary (see Section 8.4.1, “Annotation Dictionaries”); its annotation type is
TrapNet. The AP (appearances), AS (appearance state), and F (ﬂags) entries
(which ordinarily are optional) must be present, with the Print and ReadOnly
ﬂags set and all others clear (see Section 8.4.2, “Annotation Flags”). Table 9.47
shows the additional annotation dictionary entries speciﬁc to this type of anno-
tation.
The Version and AnnotStates entries, if present, are used to detect changes in the
content of a page that might require regenerating its trap networks. The Version
array identiﬁes elements of the page’s content that might be changed by an edit-
ing application and thus invalidate its trap networks. Because there is at most one
Version array per trap network annotation (and thus per page), any application
generating a new trap network must also verify the validity of existing trap net-
works by enumerating the objects identiﬁed in the array and verifying that the
results exactly match the array’s current contents. Any trap networks found to be
invalid must be regenerated. (See implementation notes 114 and 115 in Appen-
dix H.)
Beginning with PDF 1.4, the LastModiﬁed entry can be used in place of the
Version array to track changes to a page’s trap network. (The trap network anno-
tation must include either a LastModiﬁed entry or the combination of Version
and AnnotStates, but not all three.) If the modiﬁcation date in the LastModiﬁed
entry of the page object (see “Page Objects” on page 87) is more recent than the
one in the trap network annotation dictionary, then the page’s trap networks are
invalid and must be regenerated. Note, however, that not all editing applications
and plug-in extensions correctly maintain these modiﬁcation dates; this method
of tracking trap network modiﬁcations can be used reliably only in a controlled
workﬂow environment where the integrity of the modiﬁcation dates is assured.

           Trap Network Appearances

           ciated with the given page. Like all appearances, a trap network is a stream object
           deﬁning a form XObject (see Section 4.9, “Form XObjects”). The body of the
           stream contains the graphics objects needed to paint the traps making up the trap
           network. Its dictionary entries include, besides the standard entries for a form
           dictionary, the additional entries shown in Table 9.48.

       Note: Pre-separated PDF ﬁles (see Section 9.10.3, “Separation Dictionaries”) cannot
       be trapped, because traps are deﬁned along the borders between different colors and
       a pre-separated ﬁle uses only one color. Pre-separation must therefore occur after
       trapping, not before. An application pre-separating a trapped PDF ﬁle is responsible
       for calculating new Version arrays for the separated trap networks.
9.10.6 Open Prepress Interface (OPI)
       The workﬂow in a prepress environment often involves multiple applications in
       areas such as graphic design, page layout, word processing, photo manipulation,
       and document construction. As pieces of the ﬁnal document are moved from one
       application to another, it is useful to separate the data of high-resolution images,
       which can be quite large—in some cases, many times the size of the rest of the
       document combined—from that of the document itself. The Open Prepress Inter-
       face (OPI) is a mechanism, originally developed by Aldus Corporation, for cre-
       ating low-resolution placeholders, or proxies, for such high-resolution images.
       The proxy typically consists of a downsampled version of the full-resolution
       image, to be used for screen display and prooﬁng. Before the document is print-
       ed, it passes through a ﬁlter known as an OPI server, which replaces the proxies
       with the original full-resolution images.
       In PostScript programs, OPI proxies are deﬁned by PostScript code surrounded
       by special OPI comments, which specify such information as the placement and
       cropping of the image and adjustments to its size, rotation, color, and other
       attributes. In PDF, proxies are embedded in a document as image or form
       XObjects with an associated OPI dictionary (PDF 1.2) containing the same infor-
       mation conveyed in PostScript by the OPI comments. Two versions of OPI are
       supported, versions 1.3 and 2.0. In OPI 1.3, a proxy consisting of a single image,
       with no changes in the graphics state, may be represented as an image XObject;
       otherwise it must be a form XObject. In OPI 2.0, the proxy always entails changes
       in the graphics state and hence must be represented as a form XObject. (See
       implementation notes 116 and 117 in Appendix H.)
       An XObject representing an OPI proxy must contain an OPI entry in its image or
       form dictionary (see Tables 4.35 on page 267 and 4.41 on page 284). The value of
       this entry is an OPI version dictionary (Table 9.49) identifying the version of OPI
       to which the proxy corresponds. This dictionary consists of a single entry, whose
       key is the name 1.3 or 2.0 and whose value is the OPI dictionary deﬁning the
       proxy’s OPI attributes.

                                                                                                    identifying the version of OPI to which the proxy corresponds.
           Note: As in any other PDF dictionary, the key in an OPI version dictionary must be
           a name object. The OPI version dictionary would thus be written in the PDF ﬁle in
           either the form
                 << /1.3 d 0 R >>                         % OPI 1.3 dictionary
           or
                 << /2.0 d 0 R >>                         % OPI 2.0 dictionary
           where d is the object number of the corresponding OPI dictionary.
           Tables 9.50 and 9.51 describe the contents of the OPI dictionaries for OPI 1.3 and
           OPI 2.0, respectively, along with the corresponding PostScript OPI comments.
           The dictionary entries are listed in the order in which the corresponding OPI
           comments should appear in a PostScript program. Complete details on the
           meanings of these entries and their effects on OPI servers can be found in OPI:

             CImplementation Limits
IN GENERAL, PDF does not restrict the size or quantity of things described in
the ﬁle format, such as numbers, arrays, images, and so on. However, a PDF
viewer application running on a particular processor and in a particular oper-
ating environment does have such limits. If a viewer application attempts to per-
form an action that exceeds one of the limits, it will display an error.
PostScript interpreters also have implementation limits, listed in Appendix B of
the PostScript Language Reference, Third Edition. It is possible to construct a PDF
ﬁle that does not violate viewer application limits but will not print on a Post-
Script printer. Keep in mind that these limits vary according to the PostScript
language level, interpreter version, and the amount of memory available to the
interpreter.
This appendix describes typical limits for Acrobat. These limits fall into two main
classes:
• Architectural limits. The hardware on which a viewer application executes im-
  poses certain constraints. For example, an integer is usually represented in 32
  bits, limiting the range of allowed integers. In addition, the design of the soft-
  ware imposes other constraints, such as a limit to the number of elements in an
  array or string.
• Memory limits. The amount of memory available to a viewer application limits
  the number of memory-consuming objects that can be held simultaneously.
PDF itself has one architectural limit: Because ten digits are allocated to byte off-
sets, the size of a ﬁle is limited to 1010 bytes (approximately 10 gigabytes).

     C.1 General Implementation Limits
           Table C.1 describes the architectural limits for Acrobat viewer applications run-
           ning on 32-bit machines. Because Acrobat implementations are subject to these
           limits, applications producing PDF ﬁles are strongly advised to remain within
           them. Note, however, that memory limits will often be exceeded before architec-
           tural limits (such as the limit on the number of indirect objects) are reached.

QUANTITY                   LIMIT              DESCRIPTION
integer                    2,147,483,647      Largest integer value; equal to 231 − 1.
                           −2,147,483,648     Smallest integer value; equal to −231.
real                       ±32,767            Largest and smallest real values (approximate).
                           ±1 / 65,536        Nonzero real values closest to 0 (approximate); equal to ±10−38.
                                              Values closer than these are automatically converted to 0.
                           5                  Number of signiﬁcant decimal digits of precision in fractional
                                              part (approximate).

q/Q nesting                28                 Maximum depth of graphics state nesting by q and Q operators.
                                              (This is not a limit of Acrobat as such, but arises from the fact
                                              that q and Q are implemented by the PostScript gsave and
                                              grestore operators when generating PostScript output; see im-
                                              plementation note 119 in Appendix H.)
DeviceN components         8                  Maximum number of colorants or tint components in a
                                              DeviceN color space.
CID                        65,535             Maximum value of a CID (character identiﬁer).
Acrobat has some additional architectural limits:
• Thumbnail images may be no larger than 106 by 106 samples, and should be
  created at one-eighth scale for 8.5-by-11-inch and A4-size pages.
• The minimum allowed page size in Acrobat 4.0 is 3 by 3 units in default user
  space (approximately 0.04 by 0.04 inch); the maximum is 14,400 by 14,400
  units (200 by 200 inches). (See implementation note 120 in Appendix H.)
• The magniﬁcation factor of a view is constrained to be between approximately
  8 percent and 3200 percent. These limits are not ﬁxed; they vary with the size of
  the page being displayed, as well as with the size of the pages previously viewed
  within the ﬁle.
• When Acrobat reads a PDF ﬁle with a damaged or missing cross-reference
  table, it attempts to rebuild the table by scanning all the objects in the ﬁle.
  However, the generation numbers of deleted entries are lost if the cross-
  reference table is missing or severely damaged. Reconstruction fails if any ob-
  ject identiﬁers do not appear at the start of a line or if the endobj keyword does
  not appear at the start of a line. Also, reconstruction fails if a stream contains a
  line beginning with the word endstream, aside from the required endstream
  that delimits the end of the stream.
Memory limits cannot be characterized as precisely as architectural limits can, be-
cause the amount of available memory and the ways in which it is allocated vary
from one product to another. Memory is automatically reallocated from one use
to another when necessary: when more memory is needed for a particular pur-
pose, it can be taken away from memory allocated to another purpose if that
memory is currently unused or its use is nonessential (a cache, for example). Also,
data is often saved to a temporary ﬁle when memory is limited. Because of this
behavior, it is not possible to state limits for such items as the number of pages in
a document, number of text annotations or hypertext links on a page, number of
graphics objects on a page, or number of fonts on a page or in a document.
C.2 Implementation Limits Affecting Web Capture
    The data structures constructed by the Web Capture plug-in extension (PDF 1.3;
    see Section 9.9) depend on the maximum length of an array, k, which is 8191
    elements in the Acrobat 4 implementation.
    • A content set array can associate at most k content sets with a given name.
    • A content set can reference at most k objects.
    • There can be at most k source information dictionaries associated with a single
      content set.
    • A URL alias dictionary can contain at most k chains, and each chain can con-
      tain at most k URLs.
    • A maximum of k command dictionaries can be stored in the C array of the Web
      Capture information dictionary.
    • There can be at most k ÷ 2 entries in the C dictionary of a Web Capture com-
      mand settings dictionary.
                                APPENDIX D
                  DCharacter Sets and
                             Encodings
THIS APPENDIX LISTS the character sets and encodings that are assumed to be
predeﬁned in any PDF viewer application. Only simple fonts, encompassing
Latin text and some symbols, are described here. See “Predeﬁned CMaps” on
page 343 for a list of predeﬁned CMaps for CID-keyed fonts.
Section D.1, “Latin Character Set and Encodings,” describes the entire character
set for Adobe’s standard Latin-text fonts. This is the character set supported by
the Times, Helvetica, and Courier font families, which are among the standard 14
predeﬁned fonts (see “Standard Type 1 Fonts” on page 319). For each named
character, an octal character code is given in four different encodings: Standard-
Encoding, MacRomanEncoding, WinAnsiEncoding, and PDFDocEncoding (see
Table D.1). Unencoded characters are indicated by a dash (—).
Section D.2, “Expert Set and MacExpertEncoding,” describes the so-called
“expert” character set, which contains additional characters useful for sophisti-
cated typography, such as small capitals, ligatures, and fractions. For each named
character, an octal character code is given in MacExpertEncoding. Note that the
built-in encoding in an expert font program is usually different from MacExpert-
Encoding.
Sections D.3, “Symbol Set and Encoding,” and D.4, “ZapfDingbats Set and
Encoding,” describe the character sets and built-in encodings for the Symbol and
ZapfDingbats (ITC Zapf Dingbats) font programs, which are among the standard
14 predeﬁned fonts. These fonts have built-in encodings that are unique to each
font. (The characters for ZapfDingbats are ordered by code instead of by name,
since the names in that font are meaningless.)

                       TABLE D.1 Latin-text encodings
ENCODING          DESCRIPTION
StandardEncoding  Adobe standard Latin-text encoding. This is the built-in encoding
                  deﬁned in Type 1 Latin-text font programs (but generally not in
                  TrueType font programs). PDF does not have a predeﬁned encod-
                  ing named StandardEncoding. However, it is useful to describe
                  this encoding, since a font’s built-in encoding can be used as the
                  base encoding from which differences are speciﬁed in an encoding
                  dictionary.
MacRomanEncoding  Mac OS standard encoding for Latin text in Western writing sys-
                  tems. PDF has a predeﬁned encoding named MacRomanEncoding
                  that can be used with both Type 1 and TrueType fonts.
WinAnsiEncoding   Windows Code Page 1252, often called the “Windows ANSI”
                  encoding. This is the standard Windows encoding for Latin text in
                  Western writing systems. PDF has a predeﬁned encoding named
                  WinAnsiEncoding that can be used with both Type 1 and True-
                  Type fonts.
PDFDocEncoding    Encoding for text strings in a PDF document outside the docu-
                  ment’s content streams. This is one of two encodings (the other
                  being Unicode) that can be used to represent text strings; see Sec-
                  tion 3.8.1, “Text Strings.” PDF does not have a predeﬁned encod-
                  ing named PDFDocEncoding; it is not customary to use this
                  encoding to show text from fonts.
MacExpertEncoding An encoding for use with expert fonts—ones containing the
                  expert character set. PDF has a predeﬁned encoding named Mac-
                  ExpertEncoding. Despite its name, it is not a platform-speciﬁc en-
                  coding; however, only certain fonts have the appropriate character
                  set for use with this encoding. No such fonts are among the stan-
                  dard 14 predeﬁned fonts.

        1. In PDF 1.3, the euro character was added to the Adobe standard Latin character set. It
           is encoded as 200 in WinAnsiEncoding and 240 in PDFDocEncoding, assigning codes
           that were previously unused. Apple changed the Mac OS Latin-text encoding for code
           333 from the currency character to the euro character. However, this incompatible
           change has not been reﬂected in PDF’s MacRomanEncoding, which continues to map
           code 333 to currency. If the euro character is desired, an encoding dictionary can be
           used to specify this single difference from MacRomanEncoding.
        2. In PDF 1.3, the existing Zcaron and zcaron characters were added to WinAnsiEncoding
           as the previously unused codes 216 and 236.
        3. In WinAnsiEncoding, all unused codes greater than 40 map to the bullet character.
           However, only code 225 is speciﬁcally assigned to the bullet character; other codes are
           subject to future reassignment.
        4. The character names guillemotleft and guillemotright are misspelled. The correct spell-
           ing for this punctuation character is guillemet. However, the misspelled names are the
           ones actually used in the fonts and encodings containing these characters.
        5. The hyphen character is also encoded as 255 in WinAnsiEncoding. The meaning of this
           duplicate code is “soft hyphen,” but it is typographically the same as hyphen.
        6. The space character is also encoded as 312 in MacRomanEncoding and as 240 in
           WinAnsiEncoding. The meaning of this duplicate code is “nonbreaking space,” but it is
           typographically the same as space.
           This invisible paragraph references MinionExp-Regular (), Symbol (3), and Zapf-
           Dingbats (❁), which are needed in some of the PostScript-generated tables but are not
           used anywhere else in the book.

                                  APPENDIX E
                  EPDF Name Registry
THIS APPENDIX DISCUSSES a registry, maintained for developers by Adobe
Systems, that contains private names and formats used by PDF producers or
Acrobat plug-in extensions.
Acrobat enables third parties to add private data to PDF documents and to add
plug-in extensions that change viewer behavior based on this data. However,
Acrobat users have certain expectations when opening a PDF document, no mat-
ter what plug-ins are available. PDF enforces certain restrictions on private data
in order to meet these expectations.
A PDF producer or Acrobat viewer plug-in extension may deﬁne new types of
action, destination, annotation, security, and ﬁle system handlers. If a user opens
a PDF document and the plug-in that implements the new type of object is un-
available, the viewer will behave as described in Appendix H.
A PDF producer or Acrobat plug-in extension may also add keys to any PDF
object that is implemented as a dictionary, except the ﬁle trailer dictionary (see
Section 3.4.4, “File Trailer”). In addition, a PDF producer or Acrobat plug-in may
create tags that indicate the role of marked-content operators (PDF 1.2), as
described in Section 9.5, “Marked Content.”
To avoid conﬂicts with third-party names and with future versions of PDF, Adobe
maintains a registry for certain private names and formats. Developers must only
add private data that conforms to the registry rules. The registry includes three
classes:
• First class. Names and data formats that are of value to a wide range of de-
  velopers. All names deﬁned in any version of the PDF speciﬁcation are ﬁrst-
  class names. Plug-in extensions that are publicly available should often use
                                          723
   ﬁrst-class names for their private data. First-class names and data formats must
   be registered with Adobe and will be made available for all developers to use.
   To submit a private name and format for consideration as ﬁrst-class, contact
   Adobe at either of the following addresses:
       Adobe Solutions Network
       Adobe Systems Incorporated
       345 Park Avenue
       San Jose, CA 95110-2704
       <acrodevsup@adobe.com>
• Second class. Names that are applicable to a speciﬁc developer. (Adobe does not
   register second-class data formats.) Adobe distributes second-class names by
   registering developer-speciﬁc preﬁxes, which must be used as the ﬁrst char-
   acters in the names of all private data added by the developer. Adobe will not
   register the same preﬁx to two different developers, thereby ensuring that dif-
   ferent developers’ second-class names will not conﬂict. It is the responsibility
   of the developer to ensure that it does not itself use the same name in conﬂict-
   ing ways. Contact Adobe (at either of the addresses listed above) to request a

• Third class. Names that can be used only in ﬁles that will never be seen by other

   private plug-in extensions. This preﬁx, which is XX, must be used as the ﬁrst
   characters in the names of all private data added by the developer. It is not
   necessary to contact Adobe to register third-class names.

                        FLinearized PDF
A LINEARIZED PDF FILE is one that has been organized in a special way to en-
able efﬁcient incremental access in a network environment. The ﬁle is valid PDF
in all respects, and is compatible with all existing viewers and other PDF applica-
tions. Enhanced viewer applications can recognize that a PDF ﬁle has been line-
arized and can take advantage of that organization (as well as added “hint”
information) to enhance viewing performance.
The Linearized PDF ﬁle organization is an optional feature available beginning in
PDF 1.2. Its primary goal is to achieve the following behavior:
• When a document is opened, display the ﬁrst page as quickly as possible. The
   ﬁrst page to be viewed can be an arbitrary page of the document, not neces-
   sarily page 0 (though opening at page 0 is most common).
• When the user requests another page of an open document (for example, by
   going to the next page or by following a link to an arbitrary page), display that
   page as quickly as possible.
• When data for a page is delivered over a slow channel, display the page incre-
   mentally as it arrives. To the extent possible, display the most useful data ﬁrst.
• Permit user interaction, such as following a link, to be performed even before
   the entire page has been received and displayed.
This behavior should be achieved for documents of arbitrary size. The total num-
ber of pages in the document should have little or no effect on the user-perceived
performance of viewing any particular page.
The primary focus of Linearized PDF is optimized viewing of read-only PDF
documents. It is intended that the Linearized PDF will be generated once and
read many times. Incremental update is still permitted, but the resulting PDF is
                                          725
    no longer linearized and subsequently will be treated as ordinary PDF. Linear-
    izing it again may require reprocessing the entire ﬁle; see Section F.4.6, “Accessing
    an Updated File,” for details.
    Linearized PDF requires two additions to the PDF speciﬁcation:
    • Rules for the ordering of objects in the PDF ﬁle
    • Additional data structures, called hint tables, that enable efﬁcient navigation
       within the document
    Both of these additions are relatively simple to describe; however, using them
    effectively requires a deeper understanding of their purpose. Consequently, this
    appendix goes considerably beyond a simple speciﬁcation of these PDF exten-
    sions, to include background, motivation, and strategies.
    • Section F.1, “Background and Assumptions,” provides background informa-
       tion about the properties of the World Wide Web that are relevant to the design
       of Linearized PDF.
    • Section F.2, “Linearized PDF Document Structure,” speciﬁes the ﬁle format
       and object-ordering requirements of Linearized PDF.
    • Section F.3, “Hint Tables,” speciﬁes the detailed representation of the hint
       tables.
    • Section F.4, “Access Strategies,” outlines strategies for accessing Linearized PDF
       over a network, which in turn determine the optimal way to organize the PDF
       ﬁle itself.
    The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basic architecture of the Web, in-
    cluding terms such as URL, HTTP, and MIME.
F.1 Background and Assumptions
    The principal problem addressed by the Linearized PDF design is the access of
    PDF documents through the World Wide Web. This environment has the follow-
    ing important properties:
    • The access protocol (HTTP) is a transaction consisting of a request and a re-
       sponse. The client presents a request in the form of a URL, and the server sends
       a response consisting of one or more MIME-tagged data blocks.
• After a transaction has completed, obtaining more data requires a new request-
  response transaction. The connection between client and server does not ordi-
  narily persist beyond the end of a transaction, although some implementations
  may attempt to cache the open connection in order to expedite subsequent
  transactions with the same server.
• Round-trip delay can be signiﬁcant. A request-response transaction can take
  up to several seconds, independent of the amount of data requested.
• The data rate may be limited. A typical bottleneck is a slow modem link be-
  tween the client and the Internet service provider.
These properties are generally shared by other wide-area network architectures
besides the Web. Also, CD-ROMs share some of these properties, since they have
relatively slow seek times and limited data rates compared to magnetic media.
The remainder of this appendix focuses on the Web.
There are some additional properties of the HTTP protocol that are relevant to
the problem of accessing PDF ﬁles efﬁciently. These properties may not all be
shared by other protocols or network environments.
• When a PDF ﬁle is initially accessed (such as by following a URL hyperlink
  from some other document), the ﬁle type is not known to the client. Therefore,
  the client initiates a transaction to retrieve the entire document and then in-
  spects the MIME tag of the response as it arrives. Only at that point is the doc-
  ument known to be PDF. Additionally, with a properly conﬁgured server
  environment, the length of the document becomes known at that time.
• The client can abort a response while the transaction is still in progress, if it
  decides that the remainder of the data is not of immediate interest. In HTTP,
  aborting the transaction requires closing the connection, which will interfere
  with the strategy of caching the open connection between transactions.
• The client can request retrieval of portions of a document by specifying one or
  more byte ranges (by offset and count) in the HTTP request headers. Each
  range can be relative to either the beginning or the end of the ﬁle. The client
  can specify as many ranges as it wants in the request, and the response will con-
  sist of multiple blocks, each properly tagged.
• The client can initiate multiple concurrent transactions in an attempt to ob-
  tain multiple responses in parallel. This is commonly done, for instance, to
  retrieve inline images referenced from an HTML document. This strategy is
      not always reliable and may backﬁre if the transactions interfere with each
      other by competing for scarce resources in the server or the communication
      channel.
      Note: Extensive experimentation has determined that having multiple concurrent
      transactions does not work very well for PDF in some important environments.
      Therefore, Linearized PDF is designed to enable good performance to be achieved
      using only one transaction at a time. In particular, this means that the client must
      have sufﬁcient information to determine the byte ranges for all the objects required
      to display a given page of the PDF ﬁle, so that it can specify all those byte ranges in
      a single request.
    Finally, the following additional assumptions are made about the PDF viewer
    application and its local environment:
    • The viewer application has plenty of local temporary storage available. It
      should rarely need to retrieve a given portion of a PDF document more than
      once from the server.
    • The viewer application is able to display PDF data quickly once it has been
      received. The performance bottleneck is assumed to be in the transport sys-
      tem (throughput or round-trip delay), not in the processing of data after it
      arrives.
    The consequence of these assumptions is that it may be advantageous for the cli-
    ent to do considerable extra work in order to minimize delays due to communi-
    cations. Such work includes maintaining local caches and reordering actions
    according to when the needed data becomes available.
F.2 Linearized PDF Document Structure
    Except as noted below, all elements of a Linearized PDF ﬁle are as speciﬁed in
    Section 3.4, “File Structure,” and all indirect objects in the ﬁle are numbered
    sequentially in two groups, based on their order of appearance in the ﬁle.
    • The ﬁrst group consists of the document catalog, certain other document-level
      objects, and all objects belonging to the ﬁrst page of the document. These are
      numbered sequentially starting at the ﬁrst object number after the last number
      of the second group. (The stream containing the hint tables, called a hint
  stream, may be numbered out of sequence; see Section F.2.5, “Hint Streams
  (Parts 5 and 10).”)
• The second group consists of all remaining objects in the document, including
  all pages after the ﬁrst, all shared objects (objects referenced from more than
  one page, not counting objects referenced from the ﬁrst page), and so forth.
  These are numbered sequentially starting at 1.
These groups of objects are indexed by exactly two cross-reference table sections,
located as shown in Example F.1. The composition of these groups is discussed in
more detail in the sections that follow (ordered by the part number as shown in
this example, with one section for parts 5 and 10). All objects have a generation
number of 0.

F.2.1 Header (Part 1)
      The Linearized PDF ﬁle begins with the standard header line (see Section 3.4.1,
      “File Header”). Linearization is independent of PDF version number and can be
      applied to any PDF ﬁle of version 1.1 or greater.
      The “binary characters” following the percent sign on the second line are charac-
      ters with codes 128 or greater, as recommended in Section 3.4.1, “File Header.”
F.2.2 Linearization Parameter Dictionary (Part 2)
      Following the header, the ﬁrst object in the body of the ﬁle (part 2) must be an
      indirect dictionary object, the linearization parameter dictionary, containing the
      parameters listed in Table F.1. All values in this dictionary must be direct objects.
      Note that there are no references to this dictionary anywhere in the document.
      (However, there is a normal entry for it in the ﬁrst-page cross-reference table,
      part 3.)
      The linearization parameter dictionary must be entirely contained within the
      ﬁrst 1024 bytes of the PDF ﬁle. This limits the amount of data a viewer applica-
      tion must read before deciding whether the ﬁle is linearized.
F.2.3 First-Page Cross-Reference Table and Trailer (Part 3)
      Part 3 contains the cross-reference table for all the ﬁrst page’s objects (discussed
      in Section F.2.6, “First-Page Section (Part 6)”) as well as for the document catalog
      and document-level objects appearing before the ﬁrst page (discussed in Section
      F.2.4, “Document Catalog and Document-Level Objects (Part 4)”). Additionally,
      it contains entries for the linearization parameter dictionary (at the beginning)
      and the primary hint stream (at the end). This table is a valid cross-reference
      table as deﬁned in Section 3.4.3, “Cross-Reference Table,” although its position in
      the ﬁle is unconventional. It consists of a single cross-reference subsection, with
      no free entries.
      Below the table is the ﬁrst-page trailer. The startxref line at the end of the trailer
      gives the offset of the ﬁrst-page cross-reference table. The trailer’s Prev entry gives
      the offset of the main cross-reference table near the end of the ﬁle. Again, this is
      valid PDF syntax, although the trailers are linked in an unusual order. A PDF
      viewer application that is unaware of linearization interprets the ﬁrst-page cross-
      reference table as an update to an original document that is indexed by the main
      cross-reference table.
      The ﬁrst-page trailer must contain valid Size and Root entries, as well as any
      other entries needed to display the document. The Size value must be the com-
      bined number of entries in both the ﬁrst-page cross-reference table and the main
      cross-reference table.
      The ﬁrst-page trailer may optionally end with startxref, an integer, and %%EOF,
      just as in an ordinary trailer. This information is ignored.
                 TABLE F.1 Entries in the linearization parameter dictionary
PARAMETER  TYPE           VALUE
Linearized number         (Required) A version identiﬁcation for the linearized format. As usual, a
                          change in the integer part indicates an incompatible change in the linearized
                          format, while a change in the fractional part indicates a backward-compatible
                          change. The current version is 1.0.
L          integer        (Required) The length of the entire ﬁle in bytes. This must be exactly equal to
                          the actual length of the PDF ﬁle. A mismatch indicates that the ﬁle is not
                          linearized and must be treated as ordinary PDF, ignoring linearization in-
                          formation. (If the mismatch resulted from appending an update, the linear-
                          ization information may still be correct but requires validation; see Section
                          F.4.6, “Accessing an Updated File,” for details.)
H          array          (Required) An array of either two or four integers, [offset1 length1 ] or
                          [offset1 length1 offset2 length2 ]. offset1 is the offset of the primary hint
                          stream from the beginning of the ﬁle. (This is the beginning of the stream ob-
                          ject, not the beginning of the stream data.) length1 is the length of this
                          stream, including stream object overhead. If the length of the primary hint
                          stream is given by an indirect reference, the stream length object immediately
                          follows the stream object, and length1 also includes the length of the stream
                          length object, including object overhead. (See implementation note 121 in
                          Appendix H.)
                          If there is an overﬂow hint stream, offset2 and length2 specify its offset and
                          length. (See implementation note 122 in Appendix H.)
O          integer        (Required) The object number of the ﬁrst page’s page object.
E          integer        (Required) The offset of the end of the ﬁrst page (the end of part 6 in Example
                          F.1), relative to the beginning of the ﬁle. (See implementation note 123 in
                          Appendix H.)
N          integer        (Required) The number of pages in the document.
T          integer        (Required) The offset of the white-space character preceding the ﬁrst entry of
                          the main cross-reference table (the entry for object number 0), relative to the
                          beginning of the ﬁle. Note that this differs from the Prev entry in the ﬁrst-
                          page trailer, which gives the location of the xref line that precedes the table.
P          integer        (Optional) The page number of the ﬁrst page (see Section F.2.6, “First-Page
                          Section (Part 6)”). Default value: 0.
F.2.4 Document Catalog and Document-Level Objects (Part 4)
      Following the ﬁrst-page cross-reference table and trailer are the catalog diction-
      ary and other objects that are required when the document is opened. These
      additional objects (constituting part 4) include the values of the following
      entries, if they are present and are indirect objects:
      • The ViewerPreferences entry in the catalog.
      • The PageMode entry in the catalog. (Note that if the value of         PageMode is
        UseOutlines, the outline hierarchy is located in part 6; otherwise, the outline
        hierarchy, if any, is located in part 9. See Section F.2.9, “Other Objects (Part 9)”
        for details.)
      • The Threads entry in the catalog, along with all thread dictionaries it refers to.
        This does not include the threads’ information dictionaries or the individual
        bead dictionaries belonging to the threads.
      • The OpenAction entry in the catalog.
      • The AcroForm entry in the catalog. Only the top-level interactive form diction-
        ary is needed, not the objects that it refers to.
      • The Encrypt entry in the ﬁrst-page trailer dictionary. All values in the encryp-
        tion dictionary must be located here also.
      Objects that are not ordinarily needed when the document is opened should not
      be located here but instead should be at the end of the ﬁle; see Section F.2.9,
      “Other Objects (Part 9).” This includes objects such as page tree nodes, the docu-
      ment information dictionary, and the deﬁnitions for named destinations.
      Note that the objects located here are indexed by the ﬁrst-page cross-reference
      table, even though they are not logically part of the ﬁrst page.
F.2.5 Hint Streams (Parts 5 and 10)
      The core of the linearization information is stored in data structures known as
      hint tables, whose format is described in Section F.3, “Hint Tables.” They provide
      indexing information that enables the client to construct a single request for all
      the objects that are needed to display any page of the document or to retrieve cer-
      tain other information efﬁciently. The hint tables may contain additional infor-
      mation to optimize access by plug-in extensions to application-speciﬁc data.
The hint tables are not logically part of the information content of the document;
they can be derived from the document. Any action that changes the docu-
ment—for instance, appending an incremental update—will invalidate the hint
tables. The document will remain a valid PDF ﬁle but will no longer be linear-
ized; see Section F.4.6, “Accessing an Updated File,” for details.
The hint tables are binary data structures that are enclosed in a stream object.
Syntactically, this stream is a normal PDF indirect object. However, there are no
references to the stream anywhere in the document, so it is not logically part of
the document; an operation that regenerates the document may remove the
stream.
Usually, all the hint tables are contained in a single stream, known as the primary
hint stream. Optionally, there may be an additional stream containing more
hints, known as the overﬂow hint stream. The contents of the two hint streams are
to be concatenated and treated as if they were a single unbroken stream.
The primary hint stream, which is required, is shown as part 5 in Example F.1.
The order of this part and the ﬁrst-page section, shown as part 6, may be re-
versed; see Section F.4, “Access Strategies,” for considerations on the choice of
placement. The overﬂow hint stream, part 10, is optional. (See implementation
note 122 in Appendix H.)
The location and length of the primary hint stream, and of the overﬂow hint
stream if present, are given in the linearization parameter dictionary at the begin-
ning of the ﬁle.
The hint streams are assigned the last object numbers in the ﬁle—that is, after the
object number for the last object in the ﬁrst page. Their cross-reference table
entries are at the end of the ﬁrst-page cross-reference table. This object number
assignment is independent of the physical locations of the hint streams in the ﬁle.
(This convention keeps their object numbers out of the way of the numbering of
the linearized objects.)
The values of all entries in the hint streams’ dictionaries must be direct objects,
and may contain no indirect object references.
In addition to the standard stream attributes, the dictionary of the primary hint
stream contains entries giving the position of the beginning of each hint table in
the stream. These positions are given in bytes relative to the beginning of the
      stream data (after decoding ﬁlters, if any, are applied) and with the overﬂow
      hint stream concatenated if present. The dictionary of the overﬂow hint stream
      should not contain these entries. The keys designating the standard hint tables
      in the primary hint stream’s dictionary are listed in Table F.2; Section F.3, “Hint
      Tables,” documents the format of these hint tables. Additionally, there is a re-
      quired page offset hint table, which must be the ﬁrst table in the stream and
      must start at offset 0.
                                    TABLE F.2 Standard hint tables
      KEY        HINT TABLE
       S         (Required) Shared object hint table
       T         (Present only if thumbnail images exist) Thumbnail hint table
       O         (Present only if a document outline exists) Outline hint table
       A         (Present only if article threads exist) Thread information hint table
       E         (Present only if named destinations exist) Named destination hint table
       V         (Present only if an interactive form dictionary exists) Interactive form hint table

F.2.6 First-Page Section (Part 6)
      As mentioned earlier, the section containing objects belonging to the ﬁrst page of
      the document may either precede or follow the primary hint stream. The starting
      ﬁle offset and length of this section can be determined from the hint tables. In
      addition, the E entry in the linearization parameter dictionary speciﬁes the end of
      the ﬁrst page (as an offset relative to the beginning of the ﬁle), and the O entry
      gives the object number of the ﬁrst page’s page object.
This part of the ﬁle contains all the objects needed to display the ﬁrst page of the
document. Ordinarily, the “ﬁrst page” is page 0—that is, the leftmost leaf page
node in the page tree. However, if the document catalog contains an OpenAction
entry that speciﬁes opening at some page other than page 0, then that page is the
“ﬁrst page” and should be located here. The page number of the ﬁrst page is given
in the P entry of the linearization parameter dictionary. (See also implementation
note 124 in Appendix H.)
The objects contained here should include the following:
• The page object for the ﬁrst page. This must be the ﬁrst object in this part of
  the ﬁle. Its object number is given in the linearization parameter dictionary.
  This page object must explicitly specify all required attributes, such as
  Resources and MediaBox; the attributes cannot be inherited from ancestor
  page tree nodes.
• The entire outline hierarchy, if the value of the PageMode entry in the catalog
  is UseOutlines. (If the PageMode entry is omitted or has some other value and
  the document has an outline hierarchy, the outline hierarchy appears in part 9;
  see Section F.2.9, “Other Objects (Part 9)” for details.)
• All objects that the page object refers to, to an arbitrary depth, except page tree
  nodes or other page objects. This includes objects referred to by its Contents,
  Resources, Annots, and B entries, but not Thumb.
The order of objects referenced from the page object should facilitate early user
interaction and incremental display of the page data as it arrives. The following
order is recommended:
1. The Annots array and all annotation dictionaries, to a depth sufﬁcient to allow
   those annotations to be activated. Information required to draw the annota-
   tion can be deferred until later, since annotations are always drawn on top of
   (hence after) the contents.
2. The B (beads) array and all bead dictionaries, if any, for this page. If any beads
   exist for this page, the B array is required to be present in the page dictionary.
   Additionally, each bead in the thread (not just the ﬁrst bead) must contain a T
   entry referring to the associated thread dictionary.
3. The resource dictionary, but not the resource objects contained in the dic-
   tionary.
      4. Resource objects, other than the types listed below, in the order that they are
          ﬁrst referenced (directly or indirectly) from the content stream. If the contents
          are represented as an array of streams, each resource object should precede the
          stream in which it is ﬁrst referenced. Note that Font, FontDescriptor, and
          Encoding resources should be included here, but not substitutable font ﬁles
          referenced from font descriptors (see the last item below).
      5. The page contents (Contents). If large, this should be represented as an array
          of indirect references to content streams, which in turn are interleaved with
          the resources they require. If small, the entire contents should be a single con-
          tent stream preceding the resources.
      6. Image XObjects, in the order that they are ﬁrst referenced. Images are assumed
          to be large and slow to transfer, so the viewer application defers rendering
          images until all the other contents have been displayed.
      7. FontFile streams, which contain the actual deﬁnitions of embedded fonts.
          These are assumed to be large and slow to transfer, so the viewer application
          uses substitute fonts until the real ones have arrived. Only those fonts for
          which substitution is possible can be deferred in this way. (Currently, this
          includes any Type 1 or TrueType font that has a font descriptor with the
          Nonsymbolic ﬂag set, indicating the Adobe standard Latin character set).
      See Section F.4, “Access Strategies,” for additional discussion about object order
      and incremental drawing strategies.
F.2.7 Remaining Pages (Part 7)
      Part 7 of the Linearized PDF ﬁle contains the page objects and nonshared objects
      for all remaining pages of the ﬁle, with the objects for each page grouped togeth-
      er. The pages are contiguous and are ordered by page number. If the ﬁrst page of
      the ﬁle is not page 0, this section starts with page 0 and skips over the ﬁrst page
      when its position in the sequence is reached.
      For each page, the objects required to display that page are grouped together,
      except for resources and other objects that are shared with other pages. Shared
      objects are located in the shared objects section (part 8). The starting ﬁle offset
      and length of any page can be determined from the hint tables.
      The recommended order of objects within a page is essentially the same as in the
      ﬁrst page. In particular, the page object must be the ﬁrst object in each section.
      In most cases, unlike for the ﬁrst page, there will be little beneﬁt from interleav-
      ing contents with resources. This is because most resources other than images—
      fonts in particular—are shared among multiple pages and therefore reside in the
      shared objects section. Image XObjects usually are not shared, but they should
      appear at the end of the page’s section of the ﬁle, since rendering of images is de-
      ferred.
F.2.8 Shared Objects (Part 8)
      Part 8 of the ﬁle contains objects, primarily named resources, that are referenced
      from more than one page but that are not referenced (directly or indirectly) from
      the ﬁrst page. The hint tables contain an index of these objects. For more infor-
      mation on named resources, see Section 3.7.2, “Resource Dictionaries.”
      The order of these objects is essentially arbitrary. However, wherever a resource
      consists of a multiple-level structure, all components of the structure should be
      grouped together. If only the top-level object is referenced from outside the
      group, the entire group can be described by a single entry in the shared object
      hint table. This helps to minimize the size of the shared object hint table and the
      number of individual references from entries in the page offset hint table. (See
      also implementation note 125 in Appendix H.)
F.2.9 Other Objects (Part 9)
      Following the shared objects are any other objects that are part of the document
      but are not required for displaying pages. These objects are divided into func-
      tional categories. Objects within each of these categories should be grouped
      together; the relative order of the categories is unimportant.
      • The page tree. This can be located here, since the viewer application never needs
         to consult it. Note that all Resources attributes and other inheritable attributes
         of the page objects must be pushed down and replicated in each of the leaf page
         objects (but they may contain indirect references to shared objects).
      • Thumbnail images. These should simply be ordered by page number. Note that
         the thumbnail image for page 0 should be ﬁrst, even if the ﬁrst page of the doc-
         ument is some page other than 0. Each thumbnail image consists of one or
         more objects, which may refer to objects in the thumbnail shared objects sec-
         tion (see the next item).
       • Thumbnail shared objects. These are objects that are shared among some or all
          thumbnail images and are not referenced from any other objects.
       • The outline hierarchy, if not located in part 6. The order of objects should be the
          same as the order in which they are displayed by the viewer application. This is
          a preorder traversal of the outline tree, skipping over any subtree that is closed
          (that is, whose parent’s Count value is negative); following that should be the
          subtrees that were skipped over, in the order in which they would have ap-
          peared if they were all open.
       • Thread information dictionaries, referenced from the I entries of thread diction-
          aries. Note that the thread dictionaries themselves are located with the docu-
          ment catalog, and the bead dictionaries with the individual pages.
       • Named destinations. These objects include the value of the        Dests or Names
          entry in the document catalog and all the destination objects that it refers to.
          See Section F.4.2, “Opening at an Arbitrary Page.”
       • The document information dictionary and the objects contained within it.
       • The interactive form ﬁeld hierarchy. This does not include the top-level inter-
          active form dictionary, which is located with the document catalog.
       • Other entries in the document catalog that are not referenced from any page.
       • (PDF 1.3) The logical structure hierarchy.
F.2.10 Main Cross-Reference and Trailer (Part 11)
       Part 11 is the cross-reference table for all objects in the PDF ﬁle except those
       listed in the ﬁrst-page cross-reference table (part 3). As indicated earlier, this
       cross-reference table plays the role of the original cross-reference table for the ﬁle
       (before any updates are appended). It must conform to the following rules:
       • It consists of a single cross-reference subsection, beginning at object number 0.
       • The ﬁrst entry (for object number 0) must be a free entry.
       • The remaining entries are for in-use objects, which are numbered consecutive-
          ly starting at 1.
       As indicated earlier, the startxref line gives the offset of the ﬁrst-page cross-
       reference table. The Prev entry of the ﬁrst-page trailer gives the offset of the main
    cross-reference table. The main trailer has no Prev entry, and in fact does not
    need to contain any entries other than Size.
F.3 Hint Tables
    The core of the linearization information is stored in two or more hint tables, as
    indicated by the attributes of the primary hint stream (see Section F.2.5, “Hint
    Streams (Parts 5 and 10)”). The format of the standard hint tables is described in
    this section.
    There can be additional hint tables for application-speciﬁc data that is accessed
    by plug-in extensions. A generic format for such hint tables is deﬁned; see Section
    F.3.4, “Generic Hint Tables.” Alternatively, the format of a hint table can be pri-
    vate to the application; see Appendix E for further information.
    Each hint table consists of a portion of the stream, beginning at the position in
    the stream indicated by the corresponding stream attribute. Additionally, there is
    a required page offset hint table, which must be the ﬁrst table in the stream and
    must start at offset 0. (If there is an overﬂow hint stream, its contents are to be
    appended seamlessly to the primary hint stream; hint table positions are relative
    to the beginning of this combined stream.) In general, this byte stream is treated
    as a bit stream, high-order bit ﬁrst, which is then subdivided into ﬁelds of arbi-
    trary width without regard to byte boundaries. However, each hint table begins at
    a byte boundary.
    The hint tables are designed to encode the required information as compactly as
    possible. Interpreting the hint tables requires reading them sequentially; they are
    not designed for random access. The client is expected to read and decode the
    tables once and retain the information for as long as the document remains open.
    A hint table encodes the positions of various objects in the ﬁle. The representa-
    tion is either explicit (an offset from the beginning of the ﬁle) or implicit (accu-
    mulated lengths of preceding objects). Regardless of the representation, the
    resulting positions must be interpreted as if the primary hint stream itself were
    not present. That is, a position greater than the hint stream offset must have the
    hint stream length added to it in order to determine the actual offset relative to the
    beginning of the ﬁle. (The hint stream offset and hint stream length are the
    values offset1 and length1 in the H array in the linearization parameter dictionary
    at the beginning of the ﬁle.)
      The reason for this rule is that the length of the primary hint stream depends on
      the information contained within the hint tables, and this is not known until
      after they have been generated. Any information contained in the hint tables
      must not depend on knowing the primary hint stream’s length in advance.
      Note that this rule applies only to offsets given in the hint tables and not to offsets
      given in the cross-reference tables or linearization parameter dictionary. Also, the
      offset and length of the overﬂow hint stream, if present, need not be taken into
      account, since this object follows all other objects in the ﬁle.
F.3.1 Page Offset Hint Table
      The page offset hint table provides information required for locating each page.
      Additionally, for each page except the ﬁrst, it also enumerates all shared objects
      that the page references, directly or indirectly.
      This table begins with a header section, described in Table F.3, followed by one or
      more per-page entries, described in Table F.4. Note that the items making up each
      per-page entry are not contiguous; they are broken up with items from entries for
      other pages. The order of items making up the per-page entries is as follows:
      1. Item 1 for all pages, in page order starting with the ﬁrst page
      2. Item 2 for all pages, in page order starting with the ﬁrst page
      3. Item 3 for all pages, in page order starting with the ﬁrst page
      4. Item 4 for all shared objects in the second page, followed by item 4 for all
         shared objects in the third page, and so on
      5. Item 5 for all shared objects in the second page, followed by item 5 for all
         shared objects in the third page, and so on
      6. Item 6 for all pages, in page order starting with the ﬁrst page
      7. Item 7 for all pages, in page order starting with the ﬁrst page
      Note: All the “bits needed” items in Table F.3, such as item 3, may have values in the
      range 0 through 32. Although that range requires only 6 bits, 16-bit numbers are
      used.
                 TABLE F.3 Page offset hint table, header section
ITEM SIZE (BITS)    DESCRIPTION
  1     32          The least number of objects in a page (including the page object itself).
  2     32          The location of the ﬁrst page’s page object.
  3     16          The number of bits needed to represent the difference between the greatest
                    and least number of objects in a page.
  4     32          The least length of a page in bytes. This is the least length from the beginning
                    of a page object to the last byte of the last object used by that page.
  5     16          The number of bits needed to represent the difference between the greatest
                    and least length of a page, in bytes.
  6     32          The least offset of the start of any content stream, relative to the beginning of
                    its page. (See implementation note 126 in Appendix H.)
  7     16          The number of bits needed to represent the difference between the greatest
                    and least offset to the start of the content stream. (See implementation note
                    126 in Appendix H.)
  8     32          The least content stream length. (See implementation note 127 in Appen-
                    dix H.)
  9     16          The number of bits needed to represent the difference between the greatest
                    and least content stream length. (See implementation note 127 in Appen-
                    dix H.)
 10     16          The number of bits needed to represent the greatest number of shared object
                    references.
 11     16          The number of bits needed to represent the numerically greatest shared ob-
                    ject identiﬁer used by the pages (discussed further in Table F.4, item 4).
 12     16          The number of bits needed to represent the numerator of the fractional posi-
                    tion for each shared object reference. For each shared object referenced from
                    a page, there is an indication of where in the page’s content stream the object
                    is ﬁrst referenced. That position is given as the numerator of a fraction,
                    whose denominator is speciﬁed once for the entire document (in the next
                    item in this table). The fraction is explained in more detail in Table F.4,
                    item 5.
 13     16          The denominator of the fractional position for each shared object reference.
                            TABLE F.4 Page offset hint table, per-page entry
ITEM SIZE (BITS)               DESCRIPTION
 1   See Table F.3, item 3     A number that, when added to the least number of objects in a page (Table
                               F.3, item 1), gives the number of objects in the page. The ﬁrst object of the
                               ﬁrst page has an object number that is the value of the O entry in the
                               linearization parameter dictionary at the beginning of the ﬁle. The ﬁrst
                               object of the second page has an object number of 1. Object numbers for
                               subsequent pages can be determined by accumulating the number of objects
                               in all previous pages.
 2   See Table F.3, item 5     A number that, when added to the least page length (Table F.3, item 4), gives
                               the length of the page in bytes. The location of the ﬁrst object of the ﬁrst page
                               can be determined from its object number (the O entry in the linearization
                               parameter dictionary) and the cross-reference table entry for that object (see
                               Section F.2.3, “First-Page Cross-Reference Table and Trailer (Part 3)”). The
                               locations of subsequent pages can be determined by accumulating the
                               lengths of all previous pages. Note that it is necessary to skip over the primary
                               hint stream, wherever it is located.
 3   See Table F.3, item 10    The number of shared objects referenced from the page. Note that this must
                               be 0 for the ﬁrst page, and that the next two items start with the second page.
 4   See Table F.3, item 11    (One item for each shared object referenced from the page) A shared object iden-
                               tiﬁer—that is, an index into the shared object hint table (described in Section
                               F.3.2, “Shared Object Hint Table”). Note that a single entry in the shared ob-
                               ject hint table can designate a group of shared objects, only one of which is
                               referenced from outside the group. That is, shared object identiﬁers are not
                               directly related to object numbers.
                               This identiﬁer combines with the numerators provided in item 5 to form a
                               shared object reference.
 5   See Table F.3, item 12    (One item for each shared object referenced from the page) The numerator of
                               the fractional position for each shared object reference, in the same order as
                               the preceding item. The fraction indicates where in the page’s content stream
                               the shared object is ﬁrst referenced. This item is interpreted as the numerator
                               of a fraction whose denominator is speciﬁed once for the entire document
                               (Table F.3, item 13).
                               If the denominator is d, a numerator ranging from 0 to d − 1 indicates the
                               corresponding portion of the page’s content stream. For example, if the
                               denominator is 4, a numerator of 0, 1, 2, or 3 indicates that the ﬁrst reference
                               lies in the ﬁrst, second, third, or fourth quarter of the content stream, respec-
                               tively.
                                 There are two (or more) other possible values for the numerator, which indi-
                                 cate that the shared object is not referenced from the content stream but is
                                 needed by annotations or other objects that are drawn after the contents. The
                                 value d indicates that the shared object is needed before image XObjects and
                                 other nonshared objects that are at the end of the page. A value of d + 1 or
                                 greater indicates that the shared object is needed after those objects.
                                 This method of dividing the page into fractions is only approximate. Deter-
                                 mining the ﬁrst reference to a shared object entails inspecting the unencoded
                                 content stream. The relationship between positions in the unencoded and
                                 encoded streams is not necessarily linear.
6      See Table F.3, item 7     A number that, when added to the least offset to the start of the content
                                 stream (Table F.3, item 6), gives the offset in bytes of the start of the page’s
                                 content stream, relative to the beginning of the page. This is the offset of the
                                 stream object, not the stream data. (See implementation note 126 in Appen-
                                 dix H.)
7      See Table F.3, item 9     A number that, when added to the least content stream length (Table F.3,
                                 item 8), gives the length of the page’s content stream in bytes. This includes
                                 object overhead preceding and following the stream data. (See implementa-
                                 tion note 127 in Appendix H.)
  F.3.2 Shared Object Hint Table
          The shared object hint table gives information required to locate shared objects
          (see Section F.2.8, “Shared Objects (Part 8)”). Shared objects can be physically
          located in either of two places: objects that are referenced from the ﬁrst page are
          located with the ﬁrst-page objects (part 6); all other shared objects are located in
          the shared objects section (part 8).
          A single entry in the shared object hint table can actually describe a group of ad-
          jacent objects, under the following condition: Only the ﬁrst object in the group is
          referenced from outside the group; the remaining objects in the group are refer-
          enced only from other objects in the same group. The objects in a group must
          have adjacent object numbers.
          The page offset hint table, interactive form hint table, and logical structure hint
          table refer to an entry in the shared object hint table by a simple index that is its
          sequential position in the table, counting from 0.
     The shared object hint table consists of a header section (Table F.5), followed by
     one or more shared object group entries (Table F.6). There are two sequences of
     shared object group entries: the ones for objects located in the ﬁrst page, followed
     by the ones for objects located in the shared objects section. The entries have the
     same format in both cases. Note that the items making up each shared object
     group entry are not contiguous; they are broken up with items from entries for
     other shared object groups. The order of items in each sequence is as follows:
     1. Item 1 for the ﬁrst group, item 1 for the second group, and so on
     2. Item 2 for the ﬁrst group, item 2 for the second group, and so on
     3. Item 3 for the ﬁrst group, item 3 for the second group, and so on
     4. Item 4 for the ﬁrst group, item 4 for the second group, and so on
      All objects associated with the ﬁrst page (part 6) have entries in the shared object
     hint table, whether or not they are actually shared. The ﬁrst entry refers to the
     beginning of the ﬁrst page and has an object count and length that span all the
     initial nonshared objects. The next entry refers to a group of shared objects. Sub-
     sequent entries span additional groups of either shared or nonshared objects
     consecutively, until all shared objects in the ﬁrst page have been enumerated.
     (The entries that refer to nonshared objects will never be used.)
                       TABLE F.5 Shared object hint table, header section
ITEM      SIZE (BITS)       DESCRIPTION
 1            32            The object number of the ﬁrst object in the shared objects section (part 8).
 2            32            The location of the ﬁrst object in the shared objects section.
 3            32            The number of shared object entries for the ﬁrst page (including nonshared
                            objects, as noted above).
 4            32            The number of shared object entries for the shared objects section. This in-
                            cludes the number of shared object entries for the ﬁrst page (that is, the value
                            of item 3).
 5            16            The number of bits needed to represent the greatest number of objects in a
                            shared object group. (See also implementation note 128 in Appendix H.)
 6            32            The least length of a shared object group in bytes.
 7            16            The number of bits needed to represent the difference between the greatest
                            and least length of a shared object group, in bytes.
                          TABLE F.6 Shared object hint table, shared object group entry
ITEM   SIZE (BITS)                  DESCRIPTION
 1      See Table F.5, item 7       A number that, when added to the least shared object group length (Table
                                    F.5, item 6), gives the length of the object group in bytes. The location of the
                                    ﬁrst object of the ﬁrst page is given in the page offset hint table, header sec-
                                    tion (Table F.3, item 4). The locations of subsequent object groups can be de-
                                    termined by accumulating the lengths of all previous object groups until all
                                    shared objects in the ﬁrst page have been enumerated. Following that, the
                                    location of the ﬁrst object in the shared objects section can be obtained from
                                    the header section of the shared object hint table (Table F.5, item 2).
 2      1                           A ﬂag indicating whether the shared object signature (item 3) is present; its
                                    value is 1 if the signature is present and 0 if it is absent. (See also implementa-
                                    tion note 129 in Appendix H.)
 3      128                         (Only if item 2 is 1) The shared object signature, a 16-byte MD5 hash that
                                    uniquely identiﬁes the resource that the group of objects represents. This is
                                    intended to enable the client to substitute a locally cached copy of the
                                    resource instead of reading it from the PDF ﬁle. Note that this signature is
                                    unrelated to signature ﬁelds in interactive forms, as deﬁned in the section
                                    “Signature Fields” on page 547.
 4      See Table F.5, item 5       A number equal to 1 less than the number of objects in the group. The ﬁrst
                                    object of the ﬁrst page is the one whose object number is given by the O entry
                                    in the linearization parameter dictionary at the beginning of the ﬁle. Object
                                    numbers for subsequent entries can be determined by accumulating the
                                    number of objects in all previous entries, until all shared objects in the ﬁrst
                                    page have been enumerated. Following that, the ﬁrst object in the shared
                                    objects section has a number that can be obtained from the header section of
                                    the shared object hint table (Table F.5, item 1). (See also implementation note
                                    130 in Appendix H.)
           Note: In a document consisting of only one page, all of that page’s objects are never-
           theless treated as if they were shared; the shared object hint table reﬂects this. (See
           implementation note 131 in Appendix H.)
   F.3.3 Thumbnail Hint Table
           The thumbnail hint table consists of a header section (Table F.7), followed by the
           thumbnails section, which includes one or more per-page entries (Table F.8),
     each of which describes the thumbnail image for a single page. The entries are in
     page number order starting with page 0, even if the document catalog contains an
     OpenAction entry that speciﬁes opening at some page other than page 0. Thumb-
     nail images may exist for some pages and not for others.
                      TABLE F.7 Thumbnail hint table, header section
ITEM      SIZE (BITS)      DESCRIPTION
  1          32            The object number of the ﬁrst thumbnail image (that is, the thumbnail image
                           that is described by the ﬁrst entry in the thumbnails section).
  2          32            The location of the ﬁrst thumbnail image, speciﬁed as an offset from the
                           beginning of the ﬁle to that thumbnail image, minus the length of the
                           thumbnail hint table.
  3          32            The number of pages that have thumbnail images.
  4          16            The number of bits needed to represent the greatest number of consecutive
                           pages that do not have a thumbnail image.
  5          32            The least length of a thumbnail image in bytes.
  6          16            The number of bits needed to represent the difference between the greatest
                           and least length of a thumbnail image.
  7          32            The least number of objects in a thumbnail image.
  8          16            The number of bits needed to represent the difference between the greatest
                           and least number of objects in a thumbnail image.
  9          32            The object number of the ﬁrst object in the thumbnail shared objects section
                           (a subsection of part 8). These are objects (color spaces, for example) that are
                           referenced from some or all thumbnail objects and are not referenced from
                           any other objects. The thumbnail shared objects are undifferentiated; there is
                           no indication of which shared objects are referenced from any given page’s
                           thumbnail image.
 10          32            The location of the ﬁrst object in the thumbnail shared objects section, speci-
                           ﬁed as the offset from the beginning of the ﬁle to that object, minus the
                           length of the thumbnail hint table.
 11          32            The number of thumbnail shared objects.
 12          32            The length of the thumbnail shared objects section in bytes.
                               TABLE F.8 Thumbnail hint table, per-page entry
ITEM   SIZE (BITS)                DESCRIPTION
 1      See Table F.7, item 4     (Optional) The number of preceding pages lacking a thumbnail image. This
                                  indicates how many pages without a thumbnail image lie between the previ-
                                  ous entry’s page and this one.
 2      See Table F.7, item 8     A number that, when added to the least number of objects in a thumbnail
                                  image (Table F.7, item 7), gives the number of objects in this page’s thumb-
                                  nail image.
 3      See Table F.7, item 6     A number that, when added to the least length of a thumbnail image (Table
                                  F.7, item 5), gives the length of this page’s thumbnail image in bytes.
           The order of items in Table F.8 is as follows:
           1. Item 1 for all pages, in page order starting with the ﬁrst page
           2. Item 2 for all pages, in page order starting with the ﬁrst page
           3. Item 3 for all pages, in page order starting with the ﬁrst page
   F.3.4 Generic Hint Tables
           Certain categories of objects are associated with the document as a whole rather
           than with individual pages (see Section F.2.9, “Other Objects (Part 9)”), and it is
           sometimes useful to provide hints for accessing those objects efﬁciently. For each
           category of hints, there is a separate entry in the primary hint stream giving the
           starting position of the table within the stream (see Section F.2.5, “Hint Streams
           (Parts 5 and 10)”).
           There is a generic representation for such hints, speciﬁed below. This representa-
           tion is useful for some standard categories of objects, such as outline items, article
           threads, and named destinations. It may also be useful for application-speciﬁc
           objects accessed by plug-in extensions. It is considerably more convenient for a
           plug-in to use the generic hint representation than to specify custom hints.
           A generic hint table describes a single group of objects that are located together in
           the PDF ﬁle. The entries in this table are listed in Table F.9.
                                           TABLE F.9 Generic hint table
ITEM            SIZE (BITS)         DESCRIPTION
 1                 32               The object number of the ﬁrst object in the group.
 2                 32               The location of the ﬁrst object in the group.
 3                 32               The number of objects in the group.
 4                 32               The length of the object group in bytes.
   F.3.5 Interactive Form and Logical Structure Hint Tables
           If an interactive form dictionary or structure tree root is present, the interactive
           form and logical structure hint tables refer to the contents of those dictionaries;
           see Section F.2.9, “Other Objects (Part 9).” Interactive forms and logical structure
           hierarchies can refer to objects that are shared with other parts of the document,
           in which case the hint table lists those shared objects.
           An interactive form or logical structure hint table begins with the same entries as
           in a generic hint table, followed by three additional entries, as shown in Table
           F.10.
                            TABLE F.10 Interactive form or logical structure hint table
ITEM   SIZE (BITS)                  DESCRIPTION
1       32                          The object number of the ﬁrst object in the group.
2       32                          The location of the ﬁrst object in the group.
3       32                          The number of objects in the group.
4       32                          The length of the object group in bytes.
5       32                          The number of shared object references.
6       16                          The number of bits needed to represent the numerically greatest shared ob-
                                    ject identiﬁer used by the interactive form or the logical structure hierarchy.
7…      See Table F.3, item 11      Starting with item 7, each of the remaining items in this table is a shared ob-
                                    ject identiﬁer—that is, an index into the shared object hint table (described
                                    in Section F.3.2, “Shared Object Hint Table”).
F.3.6 Other Hint Tables
      The outline, thread information, named destination, information dictionary, and
      page label hint tables use the generic hint table representation; see Section F.3.4,
      “Generic Hint Tables.” The objects that they refer to are grouped together as de-
      scribed in Section F.2.9, “Other Objects (Part 9).”
  F.4 Access Strategies
      This section outlines how the client can take advantage of the structure of a
      Linearized PDF ﬁle in order to retrieve and display it efﬁciently. This material is
      not formally a part of the Linearized PDF speciﬁcation, but it may help explain
      the rationale for the organization.
F.4.1 Opening at the First Page
      As described earlier, when a document is initially accessed, a request is issued to
      retrieve the entire ﬁle, starting at the beginning. Consequently, Linearized PDF is
      organized so that all the data required to display the ﬁrst page is at the beginning
      of the ﬁle. This includes all resources that are referenced from the ﬁrst page,
      whether or not they are also referenced from other pages.
      The ﬁrst page is usually but not necessarily page 0. If the document catalog con-
      tains an OpenAction entry that speciﬁes opening at some page other than page 0,
      that page will be the one physically located at the beginning of the document.
      Thus, opening a document at the default place (rather than a speciﬁc destina-
      tion) requires simply waiting for the ﬁrst-page data to arrive; no additional trans-
      actions are required.
      In an ordinary PDF viewer application, opening a document requires ﬁrst posi-
      tioning to the end to obtain the startxref line. Since a Linearized PDF ﬁle has the
      ﬁrst page’s cross-reference table at the beginning, reading the startxref line is not
      necessary. All that is required is to verify that the ﬁle length given in the lineari-
      zation parameter dictionary at the beginning of the ﬁle matches the actual length
      of the ﬁle, indicating that no updates have been appended to the PDF ﬁle.
      The primary hint stream is located either before or after the ﬁrst-page section.
      This means that it will also be retrieved as part of the initial sequential read of the
      ﬁle. The client is expected to interpret and retain all the information in the hint
      tables. They are reasonably compact and are not designed to be obtained from
      the ﬁle in random pieces.
      The client must now decide whether to continue reading the remainder of the
      document sequentially or to abort the initial transaction and access subsequent
      pages using separate transactions requesting byte ranges. This decision is a func-
      tion of the size of the ﬁle, the data rate of the channel, and the overhead cost of a
      transaction.
F.4.2 Opening at an Arbitrary Page
      The viewer application may be requested to open a PDF ﬁle at an arbitrary page.
      The page can be speciﬁed in one of three ways:
      • By page number (remote go-to action, integer page speciﬁer)
      • By named destination (remote go-to action, name or string page speciﬁer)
      • By article thread (thread action)
      Additionally, an indexed search results in opening a document by page number.
      Handling this case efﬁciently is especially important.
      As indicated above, when the document is initially opened, it is retrieved sequen-
      tially starting at the beginning. As soon as the hint tables have been received, the
      client has sufﬁcient information to request retrieval of any page of the document
      given its page number. Therefore, it can abort the initial transaction and issue a
      new transaction for the target page, as described in Section F.4.3, “Going to
      Another Page of an Open Document.”
      The position of the primary hint stream (part 5) with respect to the ﬁrst-page
      section (part 6) determines how quickly this can be done. If the primary hint
      stream precedes the ﬁrst-page section, the initial transaction can be aborted very
      quickly; however, this is at the cost of increased delay when opening the docu-
      ment at the ﬁrst page. On the other hand, if the primary hint stream follows the
      ﬁrst-page section, displaying the ﬁrst page is quicker (since the hint tables are not
      needed for that), but opening at an arbitrary page is delayed by the time required
      to receive the ﬁrst page. The decision whether to favor opening at the ﬁrst page or
      opening at an arbitrary page must be made at the time a PDF ﬁle is linearized.
      If an overﬂow hint stream exists, obtaining it requires issuing an additional trans-
      action. For this reason, inclusion of an overﬂow hint stream in Linearized PDF,
      although permitted, is not recommended. The feature exists to allow the linear-
      izer to write the PDF ﬁle with space reserved for a primary hint stream of an esti-
      mated size, and then go back and ﬁll in the hint tables. If the estimate is too small,
      the linearizer can append an overﬂow stream containing the remaining hint table
      data. This enables the PDF ﬁle to be written in one pass, which may be an advan-
      tage if the performance of writing PDF is considered important.
      Opening at a named destination requires the viewer application ﬁrst to read the
      entire Dests or Names dictionary, for which a hint is present. Using this informa-
      tion, it is possible to determine the page containing the speciﬁc destination iden-
      tiﬁed by the name.
      Opening to an article requires the viewer application ﬁrst to read the entire
      Threads array, which is located with the document catalog at the beginning of the
      document. Using this information, it is possible to determine the page containing
      the ﬁrst bead of any thread. Opening at other than the ﬁrst bead of a thread re-
      quires chaining through all the beads until the desired one is reached; there are
      no hints to accelerate this.
F.4.3 Going to Another Page of an Open Document
      Given a page number and the information in the hint tables, it is now straight-
      forward for the client to construct a single request to retrieve any arbitrary page
      of the document. The request should include:
      • The objects of the page itself, whose byte range can be determined from the
         entry in the page offset hint table.
      • The portion of the main cross-reference table referring to those objects. This
         can be computed from main cross-reference table location (the T entry in the
         linearization parameter dictionary) and the cumulative object number in the
         page offset hint table.
      • The shared objects referenced from the page, whose byte ranges can be deter-
         mined from information in the shared object hint table.
      • The portion or portions of the main cross-reference table referring to those ob-
         jects, as described above.
      The purpose of the fractions in the page offset hint table is to enable the client to
      schedule retrieval of the page in a way that allows incremental display of the data
      as it arrives. It accomplishes this by constructing a request that interleaves pieces
      of the page contents with the shared resources that the contents refer to. This
      serves much the same purpose as the physical interleaving that is done for the
      ﬁrst page.
F.4.4 Drawing a Page Incrementally
      The ordering of objects in pages and the organization of the hint tables are in-
      tended to allow progressive update of the display and early opportunities for user
      interaction when the data is arriving slowly. The viewer application must recog-
      nize instances in which the targets of indirect object references have not yet
      arrived and, where possible, rearrange the order in which it acts on the objects in
      the page.
      The following sequence of actions is recommended:
      1. Activate the annotations, but do not draw them yet. Also activate the cursor
         feedback for any article threads in the page.
      2. Begin drawing the contents. Whenever there is a reference to an image
         XObject that has not yet arrived, skip over it. Whenever there is a reference to a
         font whose deﬁnition is an embedded font ﬁle that has not yet arrived, draw
         the text using a substitute font (if that is possible).
      3. Draw the annotations.
      4. Draw the images as they arrive, together with anything that overlaps them.
      5. Once the embedded font deﬁnitions have arrived, redraw the text using the
         correct fonts, together with anything that overlaps the text.
      The last two steps should be done using an off-screen buffer if possible, to avoid
      objectionable ﬂashing during the redraw process.
      On encountering a reference XObject (see Section 4.9.3, “Reference XObjects”),
      the viewer application may choose to initially display the object itself as a proxy
      and defer the retrieval and rendering of the imported content. Note that, since all
      XObjects in a Linearized PDF ﬁle follow the content stream of the page on which
      they appear, their retrieval is already deferred; the use of a reference XObject will
      result in an additional level of deferral.
F.4.5 Following an Article Thread
      As indicated earlier, the bead dictionaries for any article thread that visits a given
      page are located with that page. This enables the bead rectangles to be activated
      and proper cursor feedback to be shown.
      If the user follows a thread, the viewer application can obtain the object number
      from the N or P entry of the bead dictionary. This identiﬁes a target bead, which
      is located with the page to which it belongs. Given this object number, the viewer
      application can then go to that page, as discussed in Section F.4.3, “Going to
      Another Page of an Open Document.”
F.4.6 Accessing an Updated File
      As stated earlier, if a Linearized PDF ﬁle subsequently has an incremental update
      appended to it, the linearization and hints are no longer valid. Actually, this is not
      necessarily true, but the viewer application must do some additional work to val-
      idate them.
      When the viewer application sees that the ﬁle is longer than the length given in
      the linearization parameter dictionary, it must issue an additional transaction to
      read everything that was appended. It must then analyze the objects in that up-
      date to see whether any of them modify objects that are in the ﬁrst page or that
      are the targets of hints. If so, it must augment its internal data structures as neces-
      sary to take the updates into account.
      For a PDF ﬁle that has received only a small update, this approach may be worth-
      while. Accessing the ﬁle this way will be quicker than accessing it without hints or
      retrieving the entire ﬁle before displaying any of it.
                                      APPENDIX G
                       GExample PDF Files
    THIS APPENDIX PRESENTS several examples showing the structure of actual
    PDF ﬁles:
    • A minimal ﬁle that can serve as a starting point for creating other PDF ﬁles
      (and that is the basis of later examples)
    • A simple example that shows a text string—the classic “Hello World”—and a
      simple graphics example that draws lines and shapes
    • A fragment of a PDF ﬁle that illustrates the structure of the page tree for a large
      document and, similarly, two fragments that illustrate the structure of an out-
      line hierarchy
    • Finally, an example showing the structure of a PDF ﬁle as it is updated several
      times, illustrating multiple body sections, cross-reference sections, and trailers
    Note: The Length values of stream objects in the examples and the byte addresses in
    cross-reference tables are not necessarily accurate.
G.1 Minimal PDF File
    Example G.1 is a PDF ﬁle that does not draw anything; it is almost the minimum
    acceptable PDF ﬁle. It is not strictly the minimum acceptable because it contains
    an outline dictionary (Outlines in the document catalog) with a zero count (in
    which case this object would normally be omitted); a page content stream
    (Contents in the page object); and a resource dictionary (Resources in the page
    object) containing a ProcSet array. These objects were included to make this ﬁle
    useful as a starting point for creating other, more realistic PDF ﬁles.
    Table G.1 lists the objects present in this example.
                                               757
                        TABLE G.1 Objects in minimal example

      1                   Catalog (document catalog)
      2                   Outlines (outline dictionary)
      3                   Pages (page tree node)
      4                   Page (page object)
      5                   Content stream
      6                   Procedure set array
Note: When using Example G.1 as a starting point for creating other ﬁles, remember
to update the ProcSet array as needed (see Section 9.1, “Procedure Sets”). Also,
remember that the cross-reference table entries may need to have a trailing space (see
Section 3.4.3, “Cross-Reference Table”).

G.2 Simple Text String Example
    Example G.2 is the classic “Hello World” example built from the preceding exam-
    ple. It shows a single line of text consisting of the string Hello World, illustrating
    the use of fonts and several text-related PDF operators. The string is displayed in
    24-point Helvetica; because Helvetica is one of the standard 14 fonts, no font
    descriptor is needed.
    Table G.2 lists the objects present in this example.

G.4 Page Tree Example
    Example G.4 is a fragment of a PDF ﬁle illustrating the structure of the page tree
    for a large document. It contains the page tree nodes for a 62-page document;
    Figure G.2 shows the structure of this page tree. Numbers in the ﬁgure are object
    numbers corresponding to the objects in the example.

G.6 Updating Example
    This example shows the structure of a PDF ﬁle as it is updated several times; it
    illustrates multiple body sections, cross-reference sections, and trailers. In addi-
    tion, it shows that once an object has been assigned an object identiﬁer, it keeps
    that identiﬁer until the object is deleted, even if the object is altered. Finally, the
    example illustrates the reuse of cross-reference entries for objects that have been
    deleted, along with the incrementing of the generation number after an object
    has been deleted.
    The original ﬁle is that shown in Example G.1 on page 758. The updates are di-
    vided into four stages, with the ﬁle saved after each:
    1. Four text annotations are added.
    2. The text of one of the annotations is altered.
    3. Two of the text annotations are deleted.
    4. Three text annotations are added.
      The sections following show the segments added to the ﬁle at each stage.
      Throughout this example, objects are referred to by their object identiﬁers, which
      are made up of the object number and the generation number, rather than simply
      by their object numbers as in earlier examples. This is necessary because the ex-
      ample reuses object numbers, so the objects they denote are not unique.
      Note: The tables in these sections show only those objects that are modiﬁed during
      the updating process. Objects from Example G.1 that are not altered during the up-
      date are not shown.
G.6.1 Stage 1: Add Four Text Annotations
      Four text annotations are added to the initial ﬁle and the ﬁle is saved. Table G.4
      lists the objects involved in this update.
                    TABLE G.4 Object usage after adding four text annotations
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER         OBJECT TYPE
             4 0                Page (page object)
             7 0                Annotation array
             8 0                Annot (annotation dictionary)
             9 0                Annot (annotation dictionary)
            10 0                Annot (annotation dictionary)
            11 0                Annot (annotation dictionary)
      Example G.7 shows the lines added to the ﬁle by this update. The page object is
      updated because an Annots entry has been added to it. Note that the ﬁle’s trailer
      now contains a Prev entry, which points to the original cross-reference section in
      the ﬁle, while the startxref value at the end of the trailer points to the cross-
      reference section added by the update.

G.6.2 Stage 2: Modify Text of One Annotation
      One text annotation is modiﬁed and the ﬁle is saved. Example G.8 shows the lines
      added to the ﬁle by this update. Note that the ﬁle now contains two copies of the
      object with identiﬁer 10 0 (the text annotation that was modiﬁed) and that the
      added cross-reference section points to the more recent version of the object.
      This added cross-reference section contains one subsection, containing only an
      entry for the object that was modiﬁed. In addition, the Prev entry in the ﬁle’s
      trailer has been updated to point to the cross-reference section added in the pre-
      vious stage, while the startxref value at the end of the trailer points to the newly
      added cross-reference section.

G.6.3 Stage 3: Delete Two Annotations
      Two text annotation are deleted and the ﬁle is saved. Table G.5 lists the objects
      updated.
                    TABLE G.5 Object usage after deleting two text annotations
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER         OBJECT TYPE
             7 0                Annotation array
             8 0                Free
             9 0                Free
      The Annots array is the only object that is written in this update. It is updated be-
      cause it now contains two annotations fewer.
Example G.9 shows the lines added when the ﬁle was saved. Note that objects
with identiﬁers 8 0 and 9 0 have been deleted, as can be seen from the fact that
their entries in the cross-reference section end with the keyword f.
Example G.9

       [ 10 0 R
         11 0 R

   %%EOF
The cross-reference section added at this stage contains four entries, representing
object number 0, the Annots array, and the two deleted text annotations.
• The cross-reference entry for object number 0 is updated because it is the head
  of the linked list of free entries and must now point to the entry for the newly
  freed object number 8. The entry for object number 8 points to the entry for
  object number 9 (the next free entry), while the entry for object number 9 is
  the last free entry in the cross-reference table, indicated by the fact that it
  points back to object number 0.
• The entries for the two deleted text annotations are marked as free and as
  having generation numbers of 1, which will be used for any objects that reuse
  these cross-reference entries. Keep in mind that, although the two objects have
  been deleted, they are still present in the ﬁle. It is the cross-reference table that
  records the fact that they have been deleted.
      The Prev entry in the trailer has again been updated, so that it points to the cross-
      reference section added at the previous stage, and the startxref value points to the
      newly added cross-reference section.
G.6.4 Stage 4: Add Three Annotations
      Finally, three new text annotations are added to the ﬁle. Table G.6 lists the objects
      involved in this update.
                     TABLE G.6 Object usage after adding three text annotations
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER         OBJECT TYPE
            7 0                 Annotation array
            8 1                 Annot (annotation dictionary)
            9 1                 Annot (annotation dictionary)
           12 0                 Annot (annotation dictionary)
      Object numbers 8 and 9, which were used for the two annotations deleted in the
      previous stage, have been reused; however, the new objects have been given a gen-
      eration number of 1. In addition, the third text annotation added has been
      assigned the previously unused object identiﬁer of 12 0.
      Example G.10 shows the lines added to the ﬁle by this update. The added cross-
      reference section contains ﬁve entries, corresponding to object number 0, the
      Annots array, and the three annotations added. The entry for object number 0 is
      updated because the previously free entries for object numbers 8 and 9 have been
      reused. The entry for object number 0 now shows that there are no free entries in
      the cross-reference table. The Annots array is updated to reﬂect the addition of
      the three text annotations.

The annotation with object identiﬁer 12 0 illustrates splitting a long text string
across multiple lines, as well as the technique for including nonstandard charac-
ters in a string. In this case, the character is an ellipsis (…), which is character
code 203 (octal) in PDFDocEncoding, the encoding used for text annotations.
As in previous updates, the trailer’s Prev entry and startxref value have been
updated.
                                      APPENDIX H
                       HCompatibility and
                  Implementation Notes
    THE GOAL OF the Adobe Acrobat family of products is to enable people to ex-
    change and view electronic documents easily and reliably. Ideally, this means that
    any Acrobat viewer application should be able to display the contents of any PDF
    ﬁle, even if the PDF ﬁle was created long before or long after the viewer applica-
    tion itself. Of course, new versions of viewer applications are introduced to pro-
    vide additional capabilities not present before. Furthermore, beginning with
    Acrobat 2.0, viewer applications may accept plug-in extensions, making some Ac-
    robat 2.0 (and later) viewers more capable than others, depending on what exten-
    sions are present.
    Both the viewer applications and PDF itself have been designed to enable users to
    view everything in the document that the viewer application understands and to
    ignore or inform the user about objects not understood. The decision whether to
    ignore or inform the user is made on a feature-by-feature basis.
    The original PDF speciﬁcation did not deﬁne how a viewer application should
    behave when it reads a ﬁle that does not conform to the speciﬁcation. This ap-
    pendix provides that information. The PDF version associated with a ﬁle deter-
    mines how it should be treated when a viewer application encounters a problem.
    In addition, this appendix includes notes on the Adobe Acrobat implementation
    for details that are not strictly deﬁned by the PDF speciﬁcations.
H.1 PDF Version Numbers
    PDF version numbers take the form M.m, where M is the major and m the minor
    version number. Adobe increments the major version number when the PDF
    speciﬁcation changes in such a way that existing viewer applications will be un-
                                              783
likely to read a document without serious errors that prevent pages from being
viewed. The minor version number is incremented if the changes do not prevent
existing viewer applications from continuing to work, such as the addition of new
page description operators. The version number does not change at all if PDF
changes in a way that existing viewer applications are unlikely to detect. Such
changes might include the addition of private data, such as additional entries in
the document catalog, that can be gracefully ignored by applications that do not
understand it.
The header in the ﬁrst line of a PDF ﬁle speciﬁes a PDF version (see Section 3.4.1,
“File Header”). In PDF 1.4, a PDF version can also be speciﬁed in the Version en-
try of the document catalog, essentially updating the version associated with the
ﬁle by overriding the one speciﬁed in the ﬁle header (see Section 3.6.1, “Docu-
ment Catalog”). As described in the following paragraphs, the viewer applica-
tion’s behavior upon opening or saving a document depends on what it perceives
to be the document’s PDF version (compared to the viewer’s native ﬁle format—
for example, PDF 1.3 for Acrobat 4.0—which is also referred to as the viewer’s
PDF version). Viewers that are not PDF 1.4–aware may perceive the document’s
version incorrectly, because they will look for it only in the PDF ﬁle’s header and
will not see the version (if any) speciﬁed in the document catalog.
An Acrobat viewer will attempt to read any PDF ﬁle, even if the ﬁle’s version is
more recent than that of the viewer itself. It will read without errors any ﬁle that
does not require a plug-in extension, even if the ﬁle’s version is older than the
viewer’s. Some documents may require a plug-in to display an annotation, follow
a link, or execute an action. Viewer behavior in this situation is described below
in Section H.3, “Implementation Notes.” However, a plug-in is never required in
order to display the contents of a page.
If a viewer application opens a document with a major version number newer
than it expects, it warns the user that it is unlikely to be able to read the document
successfully and that the user will not be able to change or save the document. At
the ﬁrst error related to document processing, the viewer notiﬁes the user that an
error has occurred but that no further errors will be reported. (Some errors are
always reported, including ﬁle I/O errors, extension loading errors, out-of-
memory errors, and notiﬁcations that a command has failed.) Processing contin-
ues if possible. Acrobat does not permit a document with a newer than expected
major version number to be inserted into another document.
If a viewer application opens a document with a minor version number newer
than it expects, it notiﬁes the user that the document may contain information
the viewer does not understand. (This describes Acrobat 5.0’s behavior; versions
prior to that do not so notify the user.) If the viewer encounters an error, it noti-
ﬁes the user that the document version is newer than expected, that an error has
occurred, and that no further errors will be reported. Acrobat permits a docu-
ment with a newer minor version to be inserted into another document.
Whether and how the version of a document changes when the document is
modiﬁed and saved depends on several factors. If the document has a newer ver-
sion than expected, the viewer will not alter the version—that is, a document’s
version will never be changed to an older version. If the document has an older
version than expected, the viewer will update the document’s version to match
the viewer’s version. If a user modiﬁes a document by inserting another docu-
ment into it, the saved document’s version will be whichever is the most recent of
the viewer’s version, the document’s original version, and the inserted docu-
ment’s version.
If the version of a document changes, viewers that are not PDF 1.4–aware will not
be able to save the document using an incremental update, because updating the
header requires rewriting the entire ﬁle. Among other disadvantages, this can
cause existing digital signatures to become invalid. Since viewers that are PDF
1.4–aware can use the Version entry in the document catalog to update the docu-
ment’s version, they can incrementally save the document (and will do so if
necessary to preserve existing signatures). For example, if an Acrobat 5.0 user
modiﬁes a document having a PDF version earlier than 1.4, the document may
be updated incrementally when saved (with the updated version of 1.4 in the
document catalog); however, if an Acrobat 4.0 user modiﬁes a document having a
PDF version earlier than 1.3, the entire ﬁle will be rewritten when saved (with a
new header indicating version 1.3).
Again, the discussion of viewer behavior above applies to what the viewer per-
ceives to be a document’s PDF version, which may be different from the docu-
ment’s actual version if the viewer does not look for the Version entry in the
document’s catalog (a PDF 1.4 feature). One consequence of this is that a ﬁle
may be rewritten when it could have been incrementally updated. For example,
suppose an Acrobat 4.0 user opens a document having a version of 1.4 (newer
than expected), speciﬁed in the catalog’s Version entry. Acrobat 4.0 will deter-
    mine the version by looking only at the document’s header. There are two cases
    to consider:
    • The header speciﬁes version 1.2 or earlier. If the user alters and saves the docu-
       ment, the viewer will update the document’s version to match its own, by re-
       writing the ﬁle with a new header indicating version 1.3.
    • The header speciﬁes version 1.3 or later. If the user alters and saves the docu-
       ment, the viewer will allow the ﬁle to be incrementally updated, since it does
       not believe the version needs updating.
    In both cases, the version number in the document catalog will be maintained at
    1.4, so later versions of Acrobat will recognize the correct version number.
H.2 Feature Compatibility
    Many PDF features are introduced simply by adding new entries to existing dic-
    tionaries. Earlier versions of viewer applications will not notice the existence of
    such entries and will behave as if they were not there. Such new features are
    therefore both forward- and backward-compatible. Likewise, adding entries not
    described in the PDF speciﬁcation to dictionary objects does not affect the view-
    ers’ behavior. (See Appendix E for information on how to choose key names that
    are compatible with future versions of PDF.)
    In some cases, a new feature is impossible to ignore, because doing so would pre-
    clude some vital operation such as viewing or printing a page. For instance, if a
    page’s content stream is encoded with some new type of ﬁlter, then there is no
    way to view or print the page, even though the content stream (if decoded) would
    be perfectly understood by the viewer. There is little choice but to give an error in
    cases like these. Such new features are forward-compatible, but not backward-
    compatible.
    There are a few cases in which new features are deﬁned in a way that earlier view-
    er versions will ignore, but the output will be degraded in some way without any
    error indication. The most signiﬁcant example of this is transparency. All of the
    transparency features introduced in PDF 1.4 are deﬁned as new entries in existing
    dictionaries (including the graphics state parameter dictionary). A viewer that
    does not understand transparency will treat transparency group XObjects as if
    they were opaque form XObjects. This is a signiﬁcant enough deviation from the
    intended behavior that it is worth pointing out as a compatibility issue (and so is
    covered in implementation notes in this appendix).
    If a PDF document undergoes editing by an application that does not understand
    some of the features that the document uses, the occurrences of those features
    may or may not survive. If a dictionary object such as an annotation is copied
    into another document during a page insertion (or, beginning with Acrobat 2.0,
    during a page extraction), all entries are copied. If a value is an indirect reference
    to another object, that object may be copied as well, depending on the entry.
H.3 Implementation Notes
    This section gives notes on the implementation of Adobe Acrobat and on com-
    patibility between different versions of PDF. The notes are listed in the order of
    the sections to which they refer in the main text.
    1.2, “Introduction to PDF 1.4 Features”
        1. The native ﬁle formats of Adobe Acrobat products are PDF 1.2 for
            Acrobat 3.0, PDF 1.3 for Acrobat 4.0, and PDF 1.4 for Acrobat 5.0.
    3.1.2, “Comments”
        2. Acrobat viewers do not preserve comments when saving a ﬁle.
    3.2.4, “Name Objects”
        3. In PDF 1.1, the number sign character (#) could be used as part of a name
            (for example, /A#B), and the speciﬁcations did not speciﬁcally prohibit
            embedded spaces (although Adobe producer applications did not provide
            a way to write names containing them). In PDF 1.2, the number sign be-
            came an escape character, preceding two hexadecimal digits. Thus a
            3-character name A-space-B can now be written as /A#20B (since 20 is the
            hexadecimal code for the space character). This means that the name /A#B
            is no longer valid, since the number sign is not followed by two hexadeci-
            mal digits. A name object with this value must be written as /A#23B, since
            23 is the hexadecimal code for the character #.
        4. In cases where a PostScript name must be preserved, or where a string is
            permitted in PostScript but not in PDF, the Acrobat Distiller application
        uses the # convention as necessary. When an Acrobat viewer generates
        PostScript, it “inverts” the convention by writing a string, where that is
        permitted, or a name otherwise. For example, if the string (Adobe Green)
        were used as a key in a dictionary, the Distiller program would use the
        name /Adobe#20Green and the viewer would generate (Adobe Green).
   5. In Acrobat 4.0 and earlier versions, a name object being treated as text will
        typically be interpreted in a host platform encoding, which depends on
        the operating system and the local language. For Asian languages, this
        encoding may be something like Shift-JIS or Big Five. Consequently, it will
        be necessary to distinguish between names encoded this way and ones
        encoded as UTF-8. Fortunately, UTF-8 encoding is very stylized and its
        use can usually be recognized. A name that is found not to conform to
        UTF-8 encoding rules can instead be interpreted according to host plat-
        form encoding.
3.2.7, “Stream Objects”
   6. When a stream speciﬁes an external ﬁle, PDF 1.1 parsers ignore the ﬁle
        and always use the bytes between stream and endstream.
   7. Acrobat viewers accept the name DP as an abbreviation for the Decode-
        Parms key in any stream dictionary. If both DP and DecodeParms entries
        are present, DecodeParms takes precedence.
3.3, “Filters”
   8. Acrobat viewers accept the abbreviated ﬁlter names shown in Table H.1 in
        addition to the standard ones. Although the abbreviated names are
        intended for use only in the context of inline images (see Section 4.8.6,
        “Inline Images”), they are also accepted as ﬁlter names in any stream
        object.
                  TABLE H.1 Abbreviations for standard ﬁlter names
STANDARD FILTER NAME                ABBREVIATION
ASCIIHexDecode                      AHx
ASCII85Decode                       A85
LZWDecode                           LZW
FlateDecode (PDF 1.2)               Fl (uppercase F, lowercase L)
RunLengthDecode                     RL
CCITTFaxDecode                      CCF
DCTDecode                           DCT
    9. If an unrecognized ﬁlter is encountered, Acrobat viewers report the con-
        text in which the ﬁlter was found. If errors occur while a page is being dis-
        played, only the ﬁrst error is reported. The subsequent behavior depends
        on the context, as described in Table H.2. Acrobat operations that process
        pages, such as the Find command and the Create Thumbnails command,
        stop as soon as an error occurs.
                   TABLE H.2 Acrobat behavior with unknown ﬁlters
CONTEXT                      BEHAVIOR
Content stream               Page processing stops.
Indexed color space          The image does not appear, but page processing continues.
Image resource               The image does not appear, but page processing continues.
Inline image                 Page processing stops.
Thumbnail image              An error is reported and no more thumbnail images are
                             displayed, but the thumbnails can be deleted and created
                             again.
Form XObject                 The form does not appear, but page processing continues.
Type 3 glyph description     The glyph does not appear, but page processing continues.
                             The text position is adjusted based on the glyph width.
Embedded font                The viewer behaves as if the font is not embedded.
3.3.7, “DCTDecode Filter”
  10. Acrobat 4.0 and later viewers do not support the combination of the
        DCTDecode ﬁlter with any other ﬁlter if the encoded data uses the pro-
        gressive JPEG format. If a version of the Acrobat viewer earlier than 4.0
        encounters DCTDecode data encoded in progressive JPEG format, an er-
        ror occurs that will be handled according to Table H.2.
3.4, “File Structure”
  11. The restriction on line length is not enforced by any Acrobat viewer.
3.4.1, “File Header”
  12. Acrobat viewers require only that the header appear somewhere within
        the ﬁrst 1024 bytes of the ﬁle.
  13. Acrobat viewers will also accept a header of the form
           %!PS−Adobe−N.n PDF−M.m
3.4.4, “File Trailer”
  14. Acrobat viewers require only that the %%EOF marker appear somewhere
        within the last 1024 bytes of the ﬁle.
3.5, “Encryption”
  15. An Acrobat viewer will fail to open a document encrypted with a V value
        deﬁned in a version of PDF that the viewer does not understand.
3.5.2, “Standard Security Handler” (Standard Encryption Dictionary)
  16. Acrobat viewers implement this limited mode of printing as “Print As Im-
        age,” except on UNIX systems, where this feature is not available.
3.5.2, “Standard Security Handler” (Password Algorithms)
  17. In Acrobat 2.0 and 2.1 viewers, the standard security handler uses the
        empty string if there is no owner password in step 1 of Algorithm 3.3.
3.6.1, “Document Catalog”
  18. Acrobat 5.0 will avoid adding a Version entry to the document catalog; it
        will do so only if it must. Once it has done so, however, it will never re-
        move the Version entry. For documents containing a Version entry, Acro-
        bat 5.0 will attempt to ensure that the version speciﬁed in the header
        matches the version speciﬁed in the Version entry; if this is not possible, it
        will at least ensure that the latter is later than (and therefore overrides) the
        version speciﬁed in the header.
  19. An earlier version of this speciﬁcation documented the PageLayout entry
        as being in the viewer preferences dictionary (see Section 8.1, “Viewer
        Preferences”); it is actually implemented in the document catalog instead.
  20. In PDF 1.2, an additional entry in the document catalog, named AA, was
        deﬁned but was never implemented. The AA entry that is newly intro-
        duced in PDF 1.4 is entirely different from the one that was contemplated
        for PDF 1.2.
3.6.2, “Page Tree” (Page Objects)
  21. In PDF 1.2, an additional entry in the page object, named Hid, was de-
        ﬁned but was never implemented. Beginning with PDF 1.3, this entry is
        obsolete and should be ignored.
  22. Acrobat 5.0 does not accept a Contents array containing no elements.
  23. In a document containing articles, if the ﬁrst page with an article bead
        does not have a B entry, Acrobat viewers rebuild the B array for all pages of
        the document.
  24. In PDF 1.2, additional-actions dictionaries were inheritable; beginning
        with PDF 1.3, they no longer are.
3.7.1, “Content Streams”
  25. Acrobat viewers report an error the ﬁrst time they ﬁnd an unknown oper-
        ator or an operator with too few operands, but continue processing the
        content stream. No further errors are reported.
3.9.1, “Type 0 (Sampled) Functions”
  26. When printing, Acrobat performs only linear interpolation, regardless of
        the value of the Order entry.
3.9.2, “Type 2 (Exponential Interpolation) Functions”
  27. Since Type 2 functions are not deﬁned in PDF 1.2 or earlier versions,
        Acrobat 3.0 (whose native ﬁle format is PDF 1.2) will report an error,
        “Invalid Function Resource,” if it encounters a function of this type.
3.9.3, “Type 3 (Stitching) Functions”
  28. Since Type 3 functions are not deﬁned in PDF 1.2 or earlier versions,
        Acrobat 3.0 (whose native ﬁle format is PDF 1.2) will report an error,
        “Invalid Function Resource,” if it encounters a function of this type.
3.9.4, “Type 4 (PostScript Calculator) Functions”
  29. Since Type 4 functions are not deﬁned in PDF 1.2 or earlier versions,
        Acrobat 3.0 (whose native ﬁle format is PDF 1.2) will report an error,
        “Invalid Function Resource,” if it encounters a function of this type.
  30. Acrobat uses single-precision ﬂoating-point numbers for all real-number
        operations in a type 4 function.
4.5.2, “Color Space Families”
  31. If an Acrobat viewer encounters an unknown color space family name, it
        displays an error specifying the name, but reports no further errors there-
        after.
4.5.5, “Special Color Spaces” (Multitone Examples)
  32. This method of representing multitones is used by Adobe Photoshop®
        5.0.2 and subsequent versions when exporting EPS ﬁles. Beginning with
        version 4.0, Acrobat exports Level 3 EPS ﬁles using this method, and can
        also export Level 1 EPS ﬁles that use the “Level 1 separation” conventions
        of Adobe Technical Note #5044, Color Separation Conventions for Post-
        Script Language Programs. These conventions are used to emit multitone
        images as calls to “customcolorimage” with overprinting, which can then
        be placed in page layout applications such as Adobe PageMaker®, Adobe
        InDesign™, and QuarkXPress®.
4.6, “Patterns”
  33. Acrobat viewers prior to version 4.0 do not display patterns on the screen,
        although they do print them to PostScript output devices.
4.7, “External Objects”
  34. If an Acrobat viewer encounters an XObject of an unknown type, it dis-
        plays an error specifying the type of XObject, but reports no further errors
        thereafter.
4.8.4, “Image Dictionaries”
  35. Image XObjects in PDF 1.2 and earlier versions are all implicitly un-
        masked images. A PDF consumer that does not recognize the Mask entry
        will treat the image as unmasked without raising an error.
  36. All Acrobat viewers ignore the Name entry in an image dictionary.
4.8.5, “Masked Images”
  37. Explicit masking and color key masking are features of PostScript
        LanguageLevel 3. Acrobat 4.0 and later versions do not attempt to emulate
        the effect of masked images when printing to LanguageLevel 1 or
        LanguageLevel 2 output devices; they print the base image without the
        mask.
        The Acrobat 4.0 viewer will display masked images, but only when the
        amount of data in the mask is below a certain limit. Above that, the viewer
        will display the base image without the mask.
4.9.1, “Form Dictionaries”
  38. All Acrobat viewers ignore the Name entry in a form dictionary.
5.2.5, “Text Rendering Mode”
  39. In Acrobat 4.05 and earlier versions, text-showing operators such as Tj
        ﬁrst perform the ﬁlls for all the glyphs in the string being shown, followed
        by the strokes for all the glyphs. This produces incorrect results if glyphs
        overlap.
5.3.2, “Text-Showing Operators”
  40. In versions of Acrobat prior to 3.0, the horizontal coordinate of the text
        position after the TJ operator paints a character glyph and moves by any
        speciﬁed offset must not be less than it was before the glyph was painted.
  41. In Acrobat 4.0 and earlier viewers, position adjustments speciﬁed by
        numbers in a TJ array are performed incorrectly if the horizontal scaling
        parameter, Th , is different from its default value of 100.
5.5.1, “Type 1 Fonts”
  42. All Acrobat viewers ignore the Name entry in a font dictionary.
  43. Acrobat 5.0 uses the glyph widths stored in the font dictionary to override
        the widths of glyphs in the font program itself, which improves the consis-
        tency of the display and printing of the document. This addresses the situ-
        ation in which the font program used by the viewer application is
        different from the one used by the application that produced the docu-
        ment.
        The font program with the altered glyph widths might be embedded or
        not. If it is embedded, its widths should exactly match the widths in the
        font dictionary. If the font program is not embedded, Acrobat will over-
        ride the widths in the font program on the viewer application’s system
        with the widths speciﬁed in the font dictionary.
        It is important that the widths in the font dictionary match the actual
        glyph widths of the font program that was used to produce the document.
        Consumers of PDF ﬁles depend on these widths in many different con-
        texts, including viewing, printing, “fauxing” (font substitution), reﬂow,
        and word search. These operations may malfunction if arbitrary adjust-
        ments are made to the widths so that they do not represent the glyph
        widths intended by the PDF producer.
        It is recommended that diagnostic and preﬂight tools check the glyph
        widths in the font dictionary against those in an embedded font program
        and ﬂag any inconsistencies. It would also be helpful if the tools could op-
        tionally check for consistency with the widths in font programs that are
        not embedded; this is useful for checking a PDF ﬁle immediately after it is
        produced, when the original font programs are still available.
        Note: This implementation note is also referred to in Section 5.6.3,
        “CIDFonts” (Glyph Metrics in CIDFonts).
5.5.1, “Type 1 Fonts” (Standard Type 1 Fonts)
  44. Acrobat 3.0 and earlier viewers may ignore attempts to override the stan-
        dard fonts. Also, Acrobat 4.0 and earlier viewers incorrectly allow substi-
        tution fonts, such as TimesNewRoman and ArialMT, to be speciﬁed without
        FirstChar, LastChar, Widths, and FontDescriptor entries.
        Table H.3 shows the complete list of font names that are accepted as the
        names of standard fonts. In each group, the ﬁrst name (for example,
        Helvetica) is the proper one; the others (Arial, ArialMT) are alternatives.
                          TABLE H.3 Names of standard fonts
Times−Roman                       Helvetica                 Courier

5.5.3, “Font Subsets”
  45. For Acrobat 3.0 and earlier viewers, all font subsets whose BaseFont
        names differ only in their tags should have the same font descriptor values
        and should map character names to glyphs in the same way; otherwise,
        glyphs may be shown unpredictably. This restriction is eliminated in
        Acrobat 4.0.
5.5.4, “Type 3 Fonts”
  46. In principle, the value of the Encoding entry could also be the name of a
        predeﬁned encoding or an encoding dictionary whose BaseEncoding
        entry is a predeﬁned encoding. However, Acrobat 4.0 and earlier viewers
        do not implement this correctly.
  47. For compatibility with Acrobat 2.0 and 2.1, the names of resources in a
        Type 3 font’s resource dictionary must match those in the page object’s re-
        source dictionary for all pages in which the font is referenced. If backward
        compatibility is not required, any valid names may be used.
5.6.4, “CMaps”
  48. Embedded CMap ﬁles, other than ToUnicode CMaps, do not work prop-
        erly in Acrobat 4.0 viewers; this has been corrected in Acrobat 4.05.
5.7, “Font Descriptors”
  49. Acrobat viewers prior to version 3.0 ignore the FontFile3 entry. If a font
        uses the Adobe standard Latin character set (as deﬁned in Section D.1,
        “Latin Character Set and Encodings”), Acrobat creates a substitute font.
        Otherwise, Acrobat displays an error message (once per document) and
        substitutes any characters in the font with the bullet character.
5.8, “Embedded Font Programs”
  50. For simple fonts, font substitution is performed using multiple master
        Type 1 fonts. This substitution can be performed only for fonts that use
        the Adobe standard Latin character set (as deﬁned in Section D.1, “Latin
        Character Set and Encodings”). In Acrobat 3.0.1 and later, Type 0 fonts
        that use a CMap whose CIDSystemInfo dictionary deﬁnes the Adobe-GB1,
        Adobe-CNS1 Adobe-Japan1, or Adobe-Korea1 character collection can
        also be substituted. To make a document portable, it is necessary to em-
        bed fonts that cannot be substituted. The only exceptions are the Symbol
        and ZapfDingbats fonts, which are assumed to be present.
6.4.2, “Spot Functions”
  51. When the Acrobat Distiller encounters a call to the PostScript setscreen or
        sethalftone operator that includes a spot function, it compares the Post-
        Script code deﬁning the spot function with that of the predeﬁned spot
        functions shown in Table 6.1. If the code matches one of the predeﬁned
        functions, Distiller puts the name of that function into the halftone
        dictionary; Acrobat will then use that function when printing the PDF
        document to a PostScript output device. If the code does not match any of
        the predeﬁned spot functions, Distiller samples the speciﬁed spot func-
        tion and generates a function for the halftone dictionary; when printing
        to a PostScript device, Acrobat will generate a spot function that interpo-
        lates values from that function.
        When producing PDF version 1.3 or later, Distiller represents the spot
        function using a Type 4 (PostScript calculator) function whenever possi-
        ble (see Section 3.9.4, “Type 4 (PostScript Calculator) Functions”). In this
        case, Acrobat will use this function directly when printing the document.
7.5.2, “Specifying Blending Color Space and Blend Mode”
  52. PDF 1.3 or earlier viewers will ignore all transparency-related graphics
        state parameters (blend mode, soft mask, alpha constant, and alpha
        source). All graphics objects will be painted opaquely.
        Note: This implementation note is also referred to in Sections 7.5.3, “Specify-
        ing Shape and Opacity” (Mask Shape and Opacity, Constant Shape and
        Opacity) and 7.5.4, “Specifying Soft Masks” (Soft-Mask Dictionaries).
7.5.3, “Specifying Shape and Opacity” (Mask Shape and Opacity)
  53. PDF 1.3 or earlier viewers will ignore the SMask entry in an image dic-
        tionary. All images will be painted opaquely.
        Note: This implementation note is also referred to in Section 7.5.4, “Specify-
        ing Soft Masks” (Soft-Mask Images).
8.1, “Viewer Preferences”
  54. Earlier versions of the PDF speciﬁcation erroneously described an addi-
        tional entry, PageLayout, as being in the viewer preferences dictionary; it
        is actually implemented in the document catalog instead (see Section
        3.6.1, “Document Catalog”).
8.2.2, “Document Outline”
  55. In PDF 1.2, an additional entry in the outline item dictionary, named AA,
        was deﬁned but was never implemented. Beginning with PDF 1.3, this
        entry is obsolete and should be ignored.
  56. Acrobat viewers report an error when a user activates an outline item
        whose destination is of an unknown type.
8.3.1, “Page Labels”
  57. Acrobat viewers up to version 3.0 ignore the PageLabels entry and label
        pages with decimal numbers starting at 1.
8.4.1, “Annotation Dictionaries”
  58. Acrobat 4.05 and earlier versions assume that a given annotation diction-
        ary is referenced from only one page. Attempting to share an annotation
        dictionary among multiple pages will produce unpredictable behavior.
  59. Acrobat viewers update the annotation dictionary’s M entry only for text
        annotations.
  60. Acrobat 2.0 and 2.1 viewers ignore the annotation dictionary’s BS, AP, and
        AS entries.
  61. Acrobat viewers ignore the horizontal and vertical corner radii in the an-
        notation dictionary’s Border entry; the border is always drawn with
        square corners.
  62. Acrobat viewers support a maximum of ten elements in the dash array of
        the annotation dictionary’s Border entry.
8.4.2, “Annotation Flags”
  63. Acrobat viewers prior to version 3.0 ignore an annotation’s Hidden and
        Print ﬂags. Annotations that should be hidden are shown; annotations
        that should be printed are not printed. Acrobat 3.0 ignores the Print ﬂag
        for text and link annotations.
8.4.3, “Border Styles”
  64. If an Acrobat viewer encounters a border style it does not recognize, the
        border style defaults to S (Solid).
8.4.5, “Annotation Types”
  65. Acrobat viewers display annotations whose types they do not recognize in
        closed form, with an icon containing a question mark. Such an annota-
        tion can be selected, moved, or deleted, but if the user attempts to activate
        it, an alert appears giving the annotation type and reporting that a re-
        quired plug-in is unavailable.
8.4.5, “Annotation Types” (Link Annotations)
  66. Acrobat viewers report an error when a user activates a link annotation
        whose destination is of an unknown type.
8.4.5, “Annotation Types” (Markup Annotations)
  67. In Acrobat 4.0 and later versions, the text is oriented with respect to the
        vertex with the smallest y value (or the leftmost of those, if there are two
        such vertices) and the next vertex in a counterclockwise direction, regard-
        less of whether these are the ﬁrst two points in the QuadPoints array.
8.4.5, “Annotation Types” (Ink Annotations)
  68. Acrobat viewers always connect the points along each path with straight
        lines.
8.4.5, “Annotation Types” (Movie Annotations)
  69. Acrobat viewers report the following error when they encounter an anno-
        tation of type Movie: “The Plug-in required by this ‘Movie’ annotation is
        unavailable.” The annotation is displayed as a gray rectangle with a ques-
        tion mark.
8.5.2, “Trigger Events”
  70. In PDF 1.2, the additional-actions dictionary could contain entries named
        NP (next page), PP (previous page), FP (ﬁrst page), and LP (last page). The
        actions associated with these entries were never implemented; beginning
        with PDF 1.3, these entries are obsolete and should be ignored.
  71. In PDF 1.2, additional-actions dictionaries were inheritable; beginning
        with PDF 1.3, they no longer are.
  72. In Acrobat 3.0, the O and C events in a page object’s additional-actions
        dictionary are ignored if the document is not being displayed in a page-
        oriented layout mode. Beginning with Acrobat 4.0, the actions associated
        with these events are executed if the document is in a page-oriented or
        single-column layout; they are ignored if it is in a multiple-column layout.
8.5.3, “Action Types” (Launch Actions)
  73. The Acrobat viewer for the Windows platform uses the Windows function
        ShellExecute to launch an application. The Win dictionary entries corre-
        spond to the parameters of ShellExecute.
8.5.3, “Action Types” (URI Actions)
  74. URI actions are resolved by the Acrobat WebLink plug-in extension.
  75. If the appropriate plug-in extension (WebLink) is not present, Acrobat
        viewers report the following error when a link annotation that uses a URI
        action is activated: “The plug-in required by this URI action is not avail-
        able.”
8.5.3, “Action Types” (Sound Actions)
  76. In PDF 1.2, the value of the Sound entry was allowed to be a ﬁle speciﬁca-
        tion. Beginning with PDF 1.3, this is no longer supported, but the same
        effect can be achieved by using an external stream.
8.5.3, “Action Types” (Movie Actions)
  77. Acrobat viewers prior to version 3.0 report an error when they encounter
        an action of type Movie.
8.5.3, “Action Types” (Hide Actions)
  78. Acrobat viewers prior to version 3.0 report the following error when
        encountering an action of type Hide: “The plug-in needed for this Hide
        action is not available.”
  79. In Acrobat viewers, the change in an annotation’s Hidden ﬂag as a result
        of a hide action is temporary, in the sense that the user can subsequently
        close the document without being prompted to save changes, and the
        effect of the hide action will be lost. However, if the user does explicitly
        save the document before closing, such changes will be saved and will thus
        become permanent.
8.5.3, “Action Types” (Named Actions)
  80. Acrobat viewers prior to version 3.0 report the following error when en-
        countering an action of type Named: “The plug-in needed for this Named
        action is not available.”
  81. Acrobat viewers extend the list of named actions in Table 8.45 to include
        most of the menu item names available in the viewer.
8.6.2, “Field Dictionaries” (Field Names)
  82. Beginning in Acrobat 3.0, partial ﬁeld names may not contain a period.
  83. Acrobat versions 3.0 and later do not support Unicode encoding of ﬁeld
        names.
8.6.2, “Field Dictionaries” (Variable Text)
  84. Acrobat viewers may insert additional entries in the DR resource diction-
        ary, such as Encoding, as a convenience for keeping track of objects being
        used to construct form ﬁelds. Such objects are not actually resources and
        are not referenced from the appearance stream.
8.6.3, “Field Types” (Choice Fields)
  85. In Acrobat 3.0, the Opt array must be homogenous: its elements must be
        either all text strings or all arrays.
8.6.4, “Form Actions” (Submit-Form Actions)
  86. In Acrobat viewers, if the response to a submit-form action uses Forms
        Data Format (FDF), then the URL must end in #FDF so that it will be rec-
        ognized as such by the Acrobat software and handled properly. Converse-
        ly, if the response is in any other format, the URL should not end in #FDF.
8.6.4, “Form Actions” (Import-Data Actions)
  87. Acrobat viewers set the F entry to a relative ﬁle speciﬁcation locating the
        FDF ﬁle with respect to the current PDF document ﬁle. If the designated
        FDF ﬁle is not found when the import-data action is performed, Acrobat
        tries to locate the ﬁle in a few “well-known” locations depending on the
        host platform. On the Windows platform, for example, it looks in the
        directory from which Acrobat was loaded, the current directory, the
        System directory, the Windows directory, and any directories listed in the
        PATH environment variable; on Mac OS, it looks in the Preferences folder
        and the Acrobat folder.
  88. When performing an import-data action, Acrobat viewers import the
        contents of the FDF ﬁle into the current document’s interactive form,
        ignoring the F and ID entries in the FDF dictionary of the FDF ﬁle itself.
8.6.4, “Form Actions” (JavaScript Actions)
  89. Because JavaScript 1.2 is not Unicode-compatible, PDFDocEncoding and
        the Unicode encoding are translated to a platform-speciﬁc encoding prior
        to interpretation by the JavaScript engine.
8.6.6, “Forms Data Format” (FDF Header)
  90. Because a bug in versions of Acrobat prior to 5.0 prevents them from
        accepting any other version number, the FDF ﬁle header is permanently
        frozen at version 1.2. All further updates to the version number will be
        made via the Version entry in the FDF catalog dictionary instead.
8.6.6, “Forms Data Format” (FDF Catalog)
  91. The Acrobat implementation of interactive forms displays the value of the
        Status entry, if any, in an alert note when importing an FDF ﬁle.
  92. The only Encoding value supported by Acrobat 4.0 is Shift−JIS. Acrobat 5
        supports Shift−JIS, UHC, GBK, and BigFive. If any other value is speciﬁed,
        the default, PDFDocEncoding, will be used.
8.6.6, “Forms Data Format” (FDF Fields)
  93. Of all the possible entries shown in Table 8.72 on page 564, Acrobat 3.0
        will export only the V entry when generating FDF, and Acrobat 4.0 and
        later versions will export only the V and AP entries. It will, however, im-
        port FDF ﬁles containing ﬁelds using any of the described entries.
  94. If the FDF dictionary in an FDF ﬁle received as a result of a submit-form
        action contains an F entry specifying a form other than the one currently
        being displayed, Acrobat fetches the speciﬁed form before importing the
        FDF ﬁle.
  95. When exporting a form to an FDF ﬁle, Acrobat sets the F entry in the FDF
        dictionary to a relative ﬁle speciﬁcation giving the location of the FDF ﬁle
        relative to that of the ﬁle from which it was exported.
  96. If an FDF ﬁle being imported contains ﬁelds whose fully qualiﬁed names
        are not present in the form, Acrobat will discard those ﬁelds. This feature
        can be useful, for example, if an FDF ﬁle containing commonly used ﬁelds
        (such as name and address) is used to populate various types of form, not
        all of which necessarily include all of the ﬁelds available in the FDF ﬁle.
  97. As shown in Table 8.72 on page 564, the only required entry in the ﬁeld
        dictionary is T. One possible use for exporting FDF with ﬁelds containing
        T entries but no V entries is to indicate to a server which ﬁelds are desired
        in the FDF ﬁles returned in response. For example, a server accessing a
        database might use this information to decide whether to transmit all
        ﬁelds in a record or just some selected ones. As noted in implementation
        note 96 above, the Acrobat implementation of interactive forms will ig-
        nore ﬁelds in the imported FDF ﬁle that do not exist in the form.
  98. The Acrobat implementation of forms allows the option of submitting the
        data in a submit-form action in HTML Form format. This is for the bene-
        ﬁt of existing server scripts written to process such forms. Note, however,
        that any such existing scripts that generate new HTML forms in response
        will need to be modiﬁed to generate FDF instead.
8.6.6, “Forms Data Format” (FDF Pages)
  99. Acrobat renames ﬁelds by prepending a page number, a template name,
        and an ordinal number to the ﬁeld name. The ordinal number cor-
        responds to the order in which the template is applied to a page, with 0
        being the ﬁrst template speciﬁed for the page. For example, if the ﬁrst
        template used on the ﬁfth page has the name Template and has the
        Rename ﬂag set to true, ﬁelds deﬁned in that template will be renamed by
        prepending the character string P5.Template_0. to their ﬁeld names.
100. Adobe Extreme™ printing systems require that the Rename ﬂag be true.
8.7, “Sounds”
101. Acrobat supports a maximum of two sound channels.
9.1, “Procedure Sets”
102. Acrobat viewers prior to version 5.0 respond to requests for unknown
        procedure sets by warning the user that a required procedure set is un-
        available and canceling the printing operation. Acrobat 5.0 ignores proce-
        dure sets.
9.2, “Metadata”
103. Acrobat viewers display the document’s metadata in the Document Prop-
        erties dialog box and impose a limit of 255 bytes on any string represent-
        ing one of those values.
9.2.2, “Metadata Streams”
104. For backward compatibility, applications that create PDF 1.4 documents
        should include the metadata for a document in the document informa-
        tion dictionary as well as in the document’s metadata stream. Applications
        that support PDF 1.4 should check for the existence of a metadata stream
        and synchronize the information in it with that in the document informa-
        tion dictionary. The Adobe metadata framework provides a date stamp
        for metadata expressed in the framework. If this date stamp is equal to or
        later than the document modiﬁcation date recorded in the document in-
        formation dictionary, the metadata stream can be taken as authoritative.
        If, however, the document modiﬁcation date recorded in the document
        information dictionary is later than the metadata stream’s date stamp, it is
        likely that the document has been saved by an application that is not
        aware of PDF 1.4 metadata streams. In this case, information stored in the
        document information dictionary should be taken to override any seman-
        tically equivalent items in the metadata stream.
9.3, “File Identiﬁers”
105. Although the ID entry is not required, all Adobe applications that produce
        PDF ﬁles include this entry. Acrobat adds this entry when saving a ﬁle if it
        is not already present.
106. Adobe applications pass the suggested information to the MD5 message
        digest algorithm to calculate ﬁle identiﬁers. Note that the calculation of
        the ﬁle identiﬁer need not be reproducible; all that matters is that the
        identiﬁer is likely to be unique. For example, two implementations of this
        algorithm might use different formats for the current time; this will cause
        them to produce different ﬁle identiﬁers for the same ﬁle created at the
        same time, but does not affect the uniqueness of the identiﬁer.
9.9.2, “Content Database” (Digital Identiﬁers)
107. The Acrobat Web Capture plug-in treats external streams referenced with-
        in a PDF ﬁle as auxiliary data. Such streams are not used in generating the
        digital identiﬁer.
9.9.3, “Content Sets” (Image Sets)
108. In Acrobat 4.0 and later versions, if the indirect reference to an image
        XObject is not removed from the O array when its reference count reaches
        0, the XObject will never be garbage-collected during a save operation.
        The image set’s reference to the XObject may thus be considered a weak
        one that is relevant only for caching purposes; when the last strong refer-
        ence goes away, so does the weak one.
9.9.4, “Source Information” (URL Alias Dictionaries)
109. Acrobat viewers use an indirect object reference to a shared string for each
        URL in a URL alias dictionary; these strings can then be shared among the
        chains and with other data structures. It is recommended that other PDF
        viewer applications adopt this same implementation.
9.10.1, “Page Boundaries”
110. Acrobat provides various user-speciﬁed options for determining how the
        region speciﬁed by the crop box is to be imposed on the output medium
        during printing. Although these options have varied from one Acrobat
        version to another, the default behavior is as follows:
         1. Select the media size and orientation according to the operating sys-
             tem’s Print Setup dialog. (Acrobat itself has no direct control over this
             process.)
         2. Compute an effective crop box by ﬁrst clipping it with the media box,
             then rotating the page according to the page object’s Rotate entry, if
             speciﬁed.
         3. Center the crop box on the medium, rotating it if necessary to enable
             it to ﬁt in both dimensions.
         4. Optionally, scale the page up or down so that the crop box coincides
             with the edges of the medium in the more restrictive dimension.
        The description above applies only in simple printing workﬂows that lack
        any other information about how PDF pages are to be imposed on the
        output medium. In some workﬂows, there will be additional information,
        either in the PDF ﬁle itself (BleedBox, TrimBox, or ArtBox) or in a separate
        job ticket (such as JDF or PJTF). In these circumstances, other rules will
        apply, which depend on the details of the workﬂow.
        Consequently, it is recommended that PDF ﬁles initially be created with
        the crop box the same as the media box (or equivalently, with the crop box
        omitted). This ensures that if the page is printed on that size medium, the
        crop box will coincide with the edges of the medium, producing predict-
        able and dependable positioning of the page contents. On the other hand,
        if the page is printed on a different size medium, the page may be reposi-
        tioned or scaled in implementation-deﬁned or user-speciﬁed ways.
9.10.4, “Output Intents”
111. Acrobat viewers do not make use of the “to CIE” (AToB) information in
       an output intent’s ICC proﬁle.
112. Acrobat 5.0 does not make direct use of the destination proﬁle in the out-
       put intent dictionary, but third-party plug-in extensions might do so.
9.10.5, “Trapping Support” (Trap Network Annotations)
113. Older viewers may fail to maintain the trap network annotation’s required
       position at the end of the Annots array.
114. Older viewers may fail to validate trap networks before printing.
115. In Acrobat 4.0, saving a PDF ﬁle with the Optimize option selected would
       cause a page’s trap networks to be incorrectly invalidated even if the
       contents of the page had not been changed. This occurred because the
       new, optimized content stream generated for the page differed from the
       original content stream still referenced by the trap network annotation’s
       Version array. This problem has been corrected in later versions of Acro-
       bat.
9.10.6, “Open Prepress Interface (OPI)”
116. The Acrobat 3.0 Distiller application converts OPI comments into OPI
       dictionaries; when the Acrobat 3.0 viewer prints a PDF ﬁle to a PostScript
       ﬁle or printer, it converts the OPI dictionary back to OPI comments.
       However, the OPI information has no effect on the displayed image or
       form XObject.
117. Acrobat viewer and Distiller applications prior to version 4.0 do not sup-
       port OPI 2.0.
118. In Acrobat 3.0, the value of the F entry in an OPI dictionary must be a
       string.
C.1, “General Implementation Limits”
119. Acrobat viewers prior to 5.0 use the PostScript save and restore operators,
       rather than gsave and grestore, to implement q and Q and are subject to a
       nesting limit of 12 levels.
 120. In Acrobat viewers prior to version 4.0, the minimum allowed page size is
        72 by 72 units in default user space (1 inch by 1 inch); the maximum is
        3240 by 3240 units (45 by 45 inches).
F.2.2, “Linearization Parameter Dictionary (Part 2)“
 121. Acrobat requires a white-space character to follow the left bracket ( [ )
        character that begins the H array.
 122. Acrobat does not currently support reading or writing ﬁles that have an
        overﬂow hint stream.
        Note: This implementation note is also referred to in Section F.2.5, “Hint
        Streams (Parts 5 and 10).”
 123. Acrobat generates a value for the E parameter that incorrectly includes an
        object beyond the end of the ﬁrst page as if it were part of the ﬁrst page.
F.2.6, “First-Page Section (Part 6)”
 124. Acrobat always treats page 0 as the ﬁrst page for linearization, regardless of
        the value of OpenAction.
F.2.8, “Shared Objects (Part 8)”
 125. Acrobat does not generate shared object groups containing more than one
        object.
F.3.1, “Page Offset Hint Table”
 126. In Acrobat, items 6 and 7 in the header section of the page offset hint table
        are set to 0. As a result, item 6 of the per-page entry effectively does not ex-
        ist; its value is taken to be 0. That is, the sequence of bytes constituting the
        content stream for a page is described as if the content stream were the
        ﬁrst object in the page, even though it is not.
 127. Acrobat 4.0 and later versions always set item 8 equal to 0. They also set
        item 9 equal to the value of item 5, and set item 7 of each per-page hint ta-
        ble entry (Table F.4) to be the same as item 2 of the per-page entry. Acro-
        bat ignores all of these entries when reading the ﬁle.
F.3.2, “Shared Object Hint Table”
 128. In Acrobat, item 5 in the header section of the shared objects hint table is
        unused and is always set to 0.
 129. MD5 signatures are not implemented in Acrobat; item 2 in a shared object
        group entry must be 0.
 130. Acrobat does not support more than one shared object in a group; item 4
        in a shared object group entry should always be 0.
 131. In a document consisting of only one page, items 1 and 2 in the shared ob-
        ject hint table are not meaningful; Acrobat writes unpredictable values for
        these items.
