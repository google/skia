"""
THIS IS THE EXTERNAL-ONLY VERSION OF THIS FILE. G3 HAS ITS OWN.

This file contains flags for the C++ compiler, referred to by Bazel as copts.

The copts in a cc_library do not flow to the children (dependencies) nor the parents
(dependents), so we use skia_cc_library to inject them in every library along the chain.

Now that we have a modular build, this file could maybe go away and folded into our toolchains.

They are divided into several lists/selects and were initially created to be identical to the
 GN ones [2][3].
