/** \class SkPicture
    SkPicture records drawing commands made to SkCanvas. The command stream may be
    played in whole or in part at a later time.

    SkPicture is an abstract class. SkPicture may be generated by SkPictureRecorder
    or SkDrawable, or from SkPicture previously saved to SkData or SkStream.

    SkPicture may contain any SkCanvas drawing command, as well as one or more
    SkCanvas matrix or SkCanvas clip. SkPicture has a cull SkRect, which is used as
    a bounding box hint. To limit SkPicture bounds, use SkCanvas clip when
    recording or drawing SkPicture.
