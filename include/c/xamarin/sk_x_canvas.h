   This makes the contents of the canvas undefined. Subsequent calls that
   require reading the canvas contents will produce undefined results. Examples
   include blending and readPixels. The actual implementation is backend-
   dependent and one legal implementation is to do nothing. Like clear(), this
   ignores the clip.
   
   This function should only be called if the caller intends to subsequently
   draw to the canvas. The canvas may do real work at discard() time in order
   to optimize performance on subsequent draws. Thus, if you call this and then
   never draw to the canvas subsequently you may pay a perfomance penalty.

   Draw a series of points, interpreted based on the sk_point_mode_t mode. For
   all modes, the count parameter is interpreted as the total number of
   points. For LINES_SK_POINT_MODE mode, count/2 line segments are drawn.
   For POINTS_SK_POINT_MODE mode, each point is drawn centered at its coordinate, and its
   size is specified by the paint's stroke-width. It draws as a square,
   unless the paint's cap-type is round, in which the points are drawn as
   circles.
   For LINES_SK_POINT_MODE mode, each pair of points is drawn as a line segment,
   respecting the paint's settings for cap/join/width.
   For POLYGON_SK_POINT_MODE mode, the entire array is drawn as a series of connected
   line segments.
   Note that, while similar, LINES_SK_POINT_MODE and POLYGON_SK_POINT_MODE modes draw slightly
   differently than the equivalent path built with a series of moveto,
   lineto calls, in that the path will draw all of its contours at once,
   with no interactions if contours intersect each other (think XOR
   xfermode). sk_canvas_draw_paint always draws each element one at a time.
