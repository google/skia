/**
 * This object is wrapped in a GrBackendDrawableInfo and passed in as an argument to
 * drawBackendGpu() calls on an SkDrawable. The drawable will use this info to inject direct
 * Vulkan calls into our stream of GPU draws.
 *
 * The SkDrawable is given a secondary VkCommandBuffer in which to record draws. The GPU backend
 * will then execute that command buffer within a render pass it is using for its own draws. The
 * drawable is also given the attachment of the color index, a compatible VkRenderPass, and the
 * VkFormat of the color attachment so that it can make VkPipeline objects for the draws. The
 * SkDrawable must not alter the state of the VkRenderpass or sub pass.
 *
 * Additionally, the SkDrawable may fill in the passed in fDrawBounds with the bounds of the draws
 * that it submits to the command buffer. This will be used by the GPU backend for setting the
 * bounds in vkCmdBeginRenderPass. If fDrawBounds is not updated, we will assume that the entire
 * attachment may have been written to.
 *
 * The SkDrawable is always allowed to create its own command buffers and submit them to the queue
 * to render offscreen textures which will be sampled in draws added to the passed in
 * VkCommandBuffer. If this is done the SkDrawable is in charge of adding the required memory
 * barriers to the queue for the sampled images since the Skia backend will not do this.
