/**
 * The fFinishedProc is called when the Recording has been submitted and finished on the GPU, or
 * when there is a failure that caused it not to be submitted. The callback will always be called
 * and the caller can use the callback to know it is safe to free any resources associated with
 * the Recording that they may be holding onto. If the Recording is successfully submitted to the
 * GPU the callback will be called with CallbackResult::kSuccess once the GPU has finished. All
 * other cases where some failure occurred it will be called with CallbackResult::kFailed.
 *
 * Alternatively, the client can provide fFinishedProcWithStats. This provides additional
 * information about execution of the recording on the GPU. Only the stats requested using
 * fStatsFlags will be valid and only if CallbackResult is kSuccess. If both fFinishedProc
 * and fFinishedProcWithStats are provided the latter is preferred and the former won't be
 * called.
 *
 * The fTargetSurface, if provided, is used as a target for any draws recorded onto a deferred
 * canvas returned from Recorder::makeDeferredCanvas. This target surface must be provided iff
 * the Recording contains any such draws. It must be Graphite-backed and its backing texture's
 * TextureInfo must match the info provided to the Recorder when making the deferred canvas.
 *
 * fTargetTranslation is an additional translation applied to draws targeting fTargetSurface.
 *
 * fTargetClip is an additional clip applied to draws targeting fTargetSurface. It is defined in the
 * local replay space, that is, with fTargetTranslation applied. An empty clip will not be applied.
 *
 * The client may pass in two arrays of initialized BackendSemaphores to be included in the
 * command stream. At some time before issuing commands in the Recording, the fWaitSemaphores will
 * be waited on by the gpu. We only guarantee these wait semaphores block transfer and fragment
 * shader work. Similarly, at some time after issuing the Recording's commands, the
 * fSignalSemaphores will be signaled by the gpu. Depending on the platform, the timing of the wait
 * and signal operations will either be immediately before or after the given Recording's command
 * stream, respectively, or before and after the entire CommandBuffer's command stream. The
 * semaphores are not sent to the GPU until the next Context::submit call is made.
 *
 * The client will own and be responsible for deleting the underlying semaphore objects after the
 * submission completes, however the BackendSemaphore objects themselves can be deleted as soon
 * as this function returns.
