Notes:

If you change anything in the source files, or select different compiler
settings, please change the DLL name to something different than any of
the above names. Also, make sure that in your "pngusr.h" you define
PNG_USER_PRIVATEBUILD and PNG_USER_DLLFNAME_POSTFIX according to the
instructions provided in "pngconf.h".

All DLLs built by this project use the Microsoft dynamic C runtime library
MSVCRT.DLL (MSVCRTD.DLL for debug versions).  If you distribute any of the
above mentioned libraries you should also include this DLL in your package.
