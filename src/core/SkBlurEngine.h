/**
 * SkBlurEngine is a backend-agnostic provider of blur algorithms. Each Skia backend defines a blur
 * engine with a set of supported algorithms and/or implementations. A given implementation may be
 * optimized for a particular color type, sigma range, or available hardware. Each engine and its
 * algorithms are assumed to operate only on SkImages corresponding to its Skia backend, and will
 * produce output SkImages of the same type.
 *
 * Algorithms are allowed to specify a maximum supported sigma. If the desired sigma is higher than
 * this, the input image and output region must be downscaled by the caller before invoking the
 * algorithm. This is to provide the most flexibility for input representation (e.g. directly
 * rasterize at half resolution or apply deferred filter effects during the first downsample pass).
 *
 * skif::FilterResult::Builder::blur() is a convenient wrapper around the blur engine and
 * automatically handles resizing.
