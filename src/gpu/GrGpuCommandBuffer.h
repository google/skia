/**
 * The GrGpuCommandBuffer is a series of commands (draws, clears, and discards), which all target
 * the same render target. It is possible that these commands execute immediately (GL), or get
 * buffered up for later execution (Vulkan). GrOps will execute their draw commands into a
 * GrGpuCommandBuffer.
 *
 * Ideally we'd know the GrRenderTarget, or at least its properties when the GrGpuCommandBuffer, is
 * created. We also then wouldn't include it in the GrPipeline or as a parameter to the clear and
 * discard methods. The logical place for that will be in GrRenderTargetOpList post-MDB. For now
 * the render target is redundantly passed to each operation, though it will always be the same
 * render target for a given command buffer even pre-MDB.
