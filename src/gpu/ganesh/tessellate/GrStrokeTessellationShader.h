// Tessellates a batch of stroke patches directly to the canvas. Tessellated stroking works by
// creating stroke-width, orthogonal edges at set locations along the curve and then connecting them
// with a quad strip. These orthogonal edges come from two different sets: "parametric edges" and
// "radial edges". Parametric edges are spaced evenly in the parametric sense, and radial edges
// divide the curve's _rotation_ into even steps. The tessellation shader evaluates both sets of
// edges and sorts them into a single quad strip. With this combined set of edges we can stroke any
// curve, regardless of curvature.
