/**
 * PathAtlas manages one or more atlas textures that store coverage masks for path rendering.
 *
 * The contents of a PathAtlas are intended to be transient: atlas regions are considered valid only
 * for the scope of the render passes that sample them. Unlike DrawAtlas, PathAtlas does not support
 * partial eviction and reuse of subregions. Once an atlas texture is filled up, all of its
 * sub-allocations must be invalidated before it can be reused.
 *
 * PathAtlas does not prescribe how atlas contents get uploaded to the GPU. The specific task
 * mechanism is defined by subclasses.

     * `outAtlasBounds` with the atlas-space boundaries of the mask region.
     *
     * The bounds of the atlas entry is laid out with a 1 pixel outset from the given dimensions.
     *
     * `shape` will be drawn after applying the linear components (scale, rotation, skew) of the
     * provided `localToDevice` transform. This is done by  translating the shape by the inverse of
     * the rounded out `transformedShapeBounds` offset. For an unclipped shape this amounts to
     * translating it back to its origin while preserving any sub-pixel translation. For a clipped
     * shape, this ensures that the visible portions of the mask are centered in the atlas slot
     * while invisible portions that would lie outside the atlas slot get clipped out.
     *
     * `addShape()` schedules the shape to be drawn but when and how the rendering happens is
     * specified by the subclass implementation.

     * and the fill.
