/**
 * DrawPass is analogous to a subpass, storing the drawing operations in the order they are stored
 * in the eventual command buffer, as well as the surface proxy the operations are intended for.
 * DrawPasses are grouped into a RenderPassTask for execution within a single render pass if the
 * subpasses are compatible with each other.
 *
 * Unlike DrawList, DrawPasses are immutable and represent as closely as possible what will be
 * stored in the command buffer while being flexible as to how the pass is incorporated. Depending
 * on the backend, it may even be able to write accumulated vertex and uniform data directly to
 * mapped GPU memory, although that is the extent of the CPU->GPU work they perform before they are
 * executed by a RenderPassTask.
