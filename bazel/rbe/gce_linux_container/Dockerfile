# This image was created with the following 2 docker commands:
#FROM debian:bullseye-slim
#RUN apt-get update && \
#    apt-get install -y clang openjdk-11-jdk-headless \
#        fonts-dejavu-extra fonts-noto-core fonts-noto-cjk \
#        fonts-noto-color-emoji
#
# Then, after seeing what the hash was of the base image and what versions of clang and the JDK
# were installed, those versions were pinned and the image was rebuilt and pushed to make sure
# those precise versions were used. This is to reach at least SLSA level 1 in that we know exactly
# what versions of the binaries are installed on the images we used to build things.
#
# Base Image Notes:
#   I would like to be on debian:bookworm, but ran into
#   https://medium.com/nttlabs/ubuntu-21-10-and-fedora-35-do-not-work-on-docker-20-10-9-1cd439d9921
#   so had to go back to bullseye.
#
# Package Notes:
#   clang, openjdk: Bazel needs a default C++ compiler and Java runtime, but this will not be used
#                   to build Skia code.
#   fonts-dejavu-extra: The default fonts-dejavu-core do not have an italic font
#   fonts-noto-*: Coverage for many gms that test fonts
