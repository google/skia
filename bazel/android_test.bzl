    """Defines an Android test.

    Note: This macro is not intended to be used directly in BUILD files. Instead, please use macros
    android_unit_test, android_gm_test, etc.

    This macro compiles one or more C++ tests into a single Android binary and produces a script
    that runs the test on an attached Android device via `adb`. This macro is compatible with unit,
    GM and perf tests.

    This macro requires a device-specific Android platform such as //bazel/platform:pixel_5. This is
    used to decide what device-specific set-up steps to apply, such as setting CPU/GPU frequencies.

    The test target produced by this macro can be executed on a machine attached to an Android
    device. This can be either via USB, or by port-forwarding a remote ADB server (TCP port 5037)
    running on a machine attached to the target device, such as a Skolo Raspberry Pi.

    High-level overview of how this rule works:

    - It produces a <name>.tar.gz archive containing the Android binary, a minimal launcher script
      that invokes the binary on the device under test with any necessary command-line arguments,
      and any static resources needed by the C++ tests, such as fonts and images under //resources.
    - It produces a <name> test runner script that extracts the tarball into the device via `adb`,
      sets up the device, runs the test, cleans up and pipes through the test's exit code.
    - Optionally, the <name> test runner script can be configured to download from the device any
      files produced by the C++ tests (such as PNG and JSON files produced by GM tests). These
      files will be available as undeclared test outputs (see documentation for the
      TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR environment variable at
      https://bazel.build/reference/test-encyclopedia#initial-conditions).

    For CI jobs, rather than invoking "bazel test" on a Raspberry Pi attached to the Android device
    under test, we compile and run the test in two separate tasks:

    - A build task running on a GCE machine compiles the test on RBE with Bazel and stores the
      <name>.tar.gz and <name> output files to CAS.
    - A test task running on a Skolo Raspberry Pi downloads <name>.tar.gz and <name> from CAS and
      executes <name> *outside of Bazel*.

    The reason why we don't want to run Bazel on a Raspberry Pi is due to its constrained
    resources.

    Note: Although not currently supported, we could use a similar approach for Apple devices in
    in the future.

    Args:
        name: The name of the test.
        srcs: A list of C++ source files. This list should not include a main() function (see the
            requires_condition argument).
        test_runner_if_required_condition_is_satisfied: A C++ source file with a main() function to
            be appended to the srcs attribute if requires_condition is satisfied. The resulting
            program should return exit code 0 if all tests pass, or a non-zero exit code in the
            case of failures. See the requires_condition argument.
        test_runner_if_required_condition_is_not_satisfied: A C++ source file with a main()
            function to be appended to the srcs attribute if requires_condition is *not* satisfied.
            The main() function in this source file should do nothing, and the resulting program
            should always return exit code 0 to indicate that the test was successful. See the
            requires_condition argument.
        deps: Any dependencies needed by the srcs. This list should not include a main() function
            (see the requires_condition argument).
        flags: A map of strings to lists of strings to specify features that must be compiled in
            for these tests to work. For example, tests targeting our codec logic will want the
            various codecs included, but most tests won't need that.
        extra_args: Additional command-line arguments to pass to the test, for example, any
            device-specific --skip flags to skip incompatible or buggy test cases.
        requires_condition: A necessary condition for the test to work. For example, Ganesh tests
            should set this argument to "//src/gpu:has_ganesh_backend". If the condition is
            satisfied, test_runner_if_required_condition_is_satisfied will be appended to the srcs
            attribute.
            If the condition is not satisfied, test_runner_if_required_condition_is_not_satisfied
            will be included as the only source file, and no deps will be included. This prevents
            spurious build failures when using wildcard expressions (e.g.
            "bazel build //tests/...") with a configuration that is incompatible with this test.
        requires_resources_dir: If set, the contents of the //resources directory will be included
            in the tarball that is pushed to the device via `adb push`, and the test binary will be
            invoked with flag --resourcePath set to the path to said directory.
        save_output_files: If true, save any files produced by this test (e.g. PNG and JSON files
            in the case of GM tests) as undeclared outputs (see documentation for the
            TEST_UNDECLARED_OUTPUTS_DIR environment variable at
            https://bazel.build/reference/test-encyclopedia#initial-conditions).
