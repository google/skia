# This file contains the build configurations of Skia that we use for testing on the CI.
# These allow a short-form reference for our supported combinations of build features.
# https://bazel.build/docs/bazelrc#config
#
# For most build configurations, we will want to set the --cc_output_directory_tag [1]
# with a unique identifier per configuration name.
#
# By default, Bazel's "unique target BuildConfiguration" [2] incorporates the compilation_mode,
# the target platform, and some suffixes to avoid Bazel-caused and user-caused conflicts. [3] [4]
# For example, a default output directory might look like "k8-fastbuild-ST-6a54c1377847".
# Inside this output directory is a subfolder for the target (e.g. executable) name.
#
# Notably, the flags that we turn on and off via //bazel/common_config_settings do not affect
# the output directory. The output directory is used to store compiled object files (.o files)
# and generated dependency files (e.g. the output of clang --write-dependencies [5]), so having
# these be overwritten unnecessarily will slow down incremental rebuilds when switching between
# building different configurations of the same targets.

# We use spawn_strategy=local for CanvasKit builds because emscripten assumes there
# is a cache in the home directory that it needs to fill with compiled versions of libc etc.
# https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html
# By setting spawn_strategy=local, we can avoid recompiling all of this for every compilation
# unit, by letting the cache be used (and not dropped from the sandbox), which gets expensive.
# Local testing showed using the local strategy sped up a clean build from 9.5 minutes
# to 1 minute. https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#execution-strategy
