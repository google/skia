This directory contains the build rules to create the final Docker image for
the Skia jsfiddle hosted at jsfiddle.skia.org.

This build rule inserts the necessary Skia artifact (CanvasKit and PathKit) into
an intermediate Docker image created in the Skia infrastructure repository at
https://skia.googlesource.com/buildbot/+/refs/heads/main/jsfiddle/BUILD.bazel.
This final docker image is then uploaded to Artifact Registry and deployed to skia.org using Louhi.
