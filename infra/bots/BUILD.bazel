exports_files_legacy()

# This rule is a convenient way to build all the task drivers and copy them all into a single
# place as a tar folder. Otherwise, we would need to run many separate bazel build commands and
# then fish the executables out of a deep folder structure like:
# _bazel_bin/infra/bots/task_drivers/bazel_build_all/bazel_build_all_/bazel_build_all
# After this runs, the executables will all be in //_bazel_bin/built_task_drivers.tar
# Why the tar file? Windows binaries are created with .exe and other platforms are not. However,
# outs *must* be static, thus we cannot use a select. Bazel requires us to define all outputs
# exactly, so the only way to support files with different names on different platforms is to
# package them up into a file with the same name.
# Cross compilation is handled as per https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go#how-do-i-cross-compile
