The third_party directory contains a set of dependencies from outside sources
that are needed to build various components and tools within Skia.  

Some of these dependencies reside within the Skia repo, while others are pulled 
from other repositories and placed in the third_party/externals directory
during build. These external dependencies are defined in a DEPS file.

Products in third_party are subject to their own respective license terms.  The
license for each project should be included in the source itself via a license
header or file.  If the source itself does not include a license header or file,
create a README that refers to reliable documentation of the project's license
terms on the web.
