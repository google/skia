  FreeType 2.5.0
  ==============

  Homepage: http://www.freetype.org

  FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

  It  is  written  in  C,  designed to  be  small,  efficient,  highly
  customizable, and  portable while capable of  producing high-quality
  output  (glyph  images) of  most  vector  and bitmap  font  formats.

  Please   read   the  docs/CHANGES   file,   it  contains   IMPORTANT
  INFORMATION.

  Read the  files `docs/INSTALL*'  for installation  instructions; see
  the file `docs/LICENSE.TXT' for the available licenses.

  The FreeType 2 API reference is located in `docs/reference'; use the
  file   `ft2-doc.html'   as   the   top  entry   point.    Additional
  documentation is available as a separate package from our sites.  Go

  Bugs
  ====

  Please report bugs  by e-mail to `freetype-devel@nongnu.org'.  Don't
  forget to  send a  detailed explanation of  the problem --  there is
  nothing  worse than  receiving a  terse message  that only  says `it
  doesn't work'.

  Alternatively, you may submit a bug report at

    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=freetype


  Enjoy!
