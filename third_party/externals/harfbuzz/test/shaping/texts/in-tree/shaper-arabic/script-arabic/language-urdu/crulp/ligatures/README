ORIGINAL README:

Valid Ligatures of Urdu.

In 1980 Mr. Ahmad Mirza Jamil has invented a ligature based Nastaleeq writing
system. He has written about 18,000 valid ligatures of Urdu and developed a
Noori Nastaliq font. Center for Research in Urdu Language Processing (CRULP) is
releasing a soft copy of these ligatures in Unicode format. CRULP has
extensively used these ligatures for testing the fonts developed at the center
and realised that it will be a valuable resource for other font developers.
These ligatures are grouped in 2 to 8 characters and are sorted in the end
character order.

These ligatures have been copied from a "Noori Nastaliq computerised Urdu
calligraphy (list of ligatures)" calligraphically designed and compiled by
Ahmad Mirza Jamil, Elite Publishers Limited, Karachi.
