 * - In no case shall the HarfBuzz client modify memory
 *   that is passed to HarfBuzz in a blob.  If there is
 *   any such possibility, MODE_DUPLICATE should be used
 *   such that HarfBuzz makes a copy immediately,
 *
 * - Use MODE_READONLY otherse, unless you really really
 *   really know what you are doing,
 *
 * - MODE_WRITABLE is appropriate if you really made a
 *   copy of data solely for the purpose of passing to
 *   HarfBuzz and doing that just once (no reuse!),
 *
 * - If the font is mmap()ed, it's ok to use
 *   READONLY_MAY_MAKE_WRITABLE, however, using that mode
 *   correctly is very tricky.  Use MODE_READONLY instead.
