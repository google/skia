                        List of SP protocol IDs
                           sp-protocol-ids-01

Abstract

   This document is intended to be a central repository of SP protocol
   IDs.  The intention is to pass the task to IANA later on.

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on December 7, 2014.

Internet-Draft           List of SP protocol IDs               June 2014


1.  Introduction

   Different mappings for scalability protocols (see, for example
   SPoverTCP [SPoverTCP]) define a protocol header which in turn
   contains SP endpoint type ID.  The ID consists of protocol ID and end
   the endpoint role:

   +-----------------------+------------------------+
   | Protocol ID (12 bits) | Endpoint role (4 bits) |
   +-----------------------+------------------------+

   Protocol IDs denote the SP protocol used (such as request/reply or
   publish/subscribe), while endpoint role determines the role of the
   endpoint within the topology (requester vs. replier, publisher vs.
   subscriber et c.)  Both numbers are in network byte order.

   Protocol IDs are global, while endpoint roles are specific to any
   given protocol.  As such, protocol IDs are defined in this document,
   while endpoint roles are defined in specific SP protocol RFCs.

   Note that there's no versioning of SP protocols.  New versions of old
   protocols should register with new protocol ID.

2.  Protocol IDs

   1 - pair (v1)

   2 - publish/subscribe (v1)

   3 - request/reply (v1)

   4 - unassigned

   5 - pipeline (v1)

   6 - survey (v1)

   7 - bus (v1)

   8-3839 - unassigned

   3840-4095 local and experimental

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo describes numbers that should be eventually managed by
   IANA.
