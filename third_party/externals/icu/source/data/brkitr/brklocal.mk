# Note:
#
#   If you are thinking of modifying this file, READ THIS.
#
# Instead of changing this file [unless you want to check it back in],
# you should consider creating a '%local%' file in this same directory.
# Then, you can have your local changes remain even if you upgrade or
# reconfigure ICU.
#
# Example '%local%' files:
#
#  * To add an additional locale to the list:
#    _____________________________________________________
#    |  BRK_RES_SOURCE_LOCAL =   myLocale.txt ...
#
#  * To REPLACE the default list and only build with a few
#    locales:
#    _____________________________________________________
#    |  BRK_RES_SOURCE = ar.txt ar_AE.txt en.txt de.txt zh.txt
#
