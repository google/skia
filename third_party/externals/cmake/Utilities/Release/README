To create a cmake release, make sure the "release" tag is pointing to the
expected git commit:

http://cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/release

Then as kitware@hythloth, using an up-to-date CMake:

  cd ~/CMakeReleases/cmake/Utilities/Release
  mkdir 283rc1
  cd 283rc1
  ~/CMakeReleases/build/bin/cmake -DCMAKE_CREATE_VERSION=release -P ../create-cmake-release.cmake
  ./create-release.sh


create-cmake-release.cmake:  script to run to create release sh scripts
Add or remove machines in create-cmake-release.cmake.

Cygwin -> directory that contains cpack cygwin package files used in
 CMakeCPack.cmake

machine_release.cmake : config files for each machine
