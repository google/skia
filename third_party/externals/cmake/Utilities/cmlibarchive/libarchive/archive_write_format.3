Streaming Archive Library (libarchive, -larchive)

.Ft int
.Fn archive_write_set_format_cpio "struct archive *"
.Ft int
.Fn archive_write_set_format_pax "struct archive *"

.Ft int
.Fn archive_write_set_format_ustar "struct archive *"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions set the format that will be used for the archive.
.Pp
The library can write
POSIX octet-oriented cpio format archives,
POSIX-standard
.Dq pax interchange
format archives,
traditional
.Dq shar
archives,
enhanced
.Dq dump
shar archives that store a variety of file attributes and handle binary files,
and
POSIX-standard
.Dq ustar
archives.
The pax interchange format is a backwards-compatible tar format that
adds key/value attributes to each entry and supports arbitrary
filenames, linknames, uids, sizes, etc.
.Dq Restricted pax interchange format
is the library default; this is the same as pax format, but suppresses
the pax extended header for most normal files.
In most cases, this will result in ordinary ustar archives.
