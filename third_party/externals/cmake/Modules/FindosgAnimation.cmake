# FindosgAnimation
# ----------------
#
#
#
# This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
# components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
# module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer
# if needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you
# control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
# out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular
# module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't
# work with your system as an example).  If you want to use a more
# convenient module that includes everything, use the
# FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.
#
# Locate osgAnimation This module defines
#
# OSGANIMATION_FOUND - Was osgAnimation found? OSGANIMATION_INCLUDE_DIR
# - Where to find the headers OSGANIMATION_LIBRARIES - The libraries to
# link against for the OSG (use this)
#
# OSGANIMATION_LIBRARY - The OSG library OSGANIMATION_LIBRARY_DEBUG -
# The OSG debug library
#
# $OSGDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
# ./configure --prefix=$OSGDIR used in building osg.
