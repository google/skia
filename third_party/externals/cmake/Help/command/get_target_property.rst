get_target_property
-------------------

Get a property from a target.

::

  get_target_property(VAR target property)

Get a property from a target.  The value of the property is stored in
the variable VAR.  If the property is not found, VAR will be set to
"NOTFOUND".  Use set_target_properties to set property values.
Properties are usually used to control how a target is built, but some
query the target instead.  This command can get properties for any
target so far created.  The targets do not need to be in the current
CMakeLists.txt file.

See also the more general get_property() command.
