CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
---------------------------------

Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true
will append directories in the linker search path and outside the
project to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This is used to initialize the target
property INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all targets.
