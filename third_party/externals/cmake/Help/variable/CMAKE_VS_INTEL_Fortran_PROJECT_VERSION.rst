CMAKE_VS_INTEL_Fortran_PROJECT_VERSION
--------------------------------------

When generating for Visual Studio 7 or greater with the Intel Fortran
plugin installed, this specifies the .vfproj project file format
version.  This is intended for internal use by CMake and should not be
used by project code.
