EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
----------------

Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.

A property on a directory that indicates if its targets are excluded
from the default build target.  If it is not, then with a Makefile for
example typing make will cause the targets to be built.  The same
concept applies to the default build of other generators.
