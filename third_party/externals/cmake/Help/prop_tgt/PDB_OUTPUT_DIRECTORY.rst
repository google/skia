PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
--------------------

Output directory for the MS debug symbols ``.pdb`` file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.

This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
will be placed by the linker.  This property is initialized by the
value of the :variable:`CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` variable if it is
set when a target is created.
