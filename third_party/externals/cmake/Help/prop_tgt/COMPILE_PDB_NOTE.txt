.. note::
 The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the
 ``/Fd`` compiler flag and are not the same as linker-generated
 program database files specified by the ``/pdb`` linker flag.
 Use the |PDB_XXX| property to specify the latter.

 This property is not implemented by the :generator:`Visual Studio 6`
 generator.
