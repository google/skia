WRAP_EXCLUDE
------------

Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to
provide additional functionality.  For example, C++ code can be
wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc.  If WRAP_EXCLUDE is
set to true (1 etc) that indicates that this source file should not be
wrapped.
