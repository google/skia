USE_FOLDERS
-----------

Use the FOLDER target property to organize targets into folders.

If not set, CMake treats this property as OFF by default.  CMake
generators that are capable of organizing into a hierarchy of folders
use the values of the FOLDER target property to name those folders.
See also the documentation for the FOLDER target property.
