KWSys provides a platform-independent API to many common system
features that are implemented differently on every platform.  This
library is intended to be shared among many projects, so it has a
configurable namespace.  Each project should configure KWSys to use a
namespace unique to itself.  See comments in CMakeLists.txt for
details.

You are probably reading this file in the source tree of a surrounding
project.  In that case, see "../README.kwsys" for details of using
KWSys in your project.

See CONTRIBUTING.rst for instructions to contribute KWSys changes.
