Need to produce two tar files:

Source-

- create subdirs
- copy src
- duplicate src
- configure files into duplicate src
   CPack.cygwin-readme.in
   CPack.cygwin-install.sh.in
   CPack.setup.hint.in
- diff duplicate src and orig src
- write diff into toplevel
- create tar file call super class

cmake-2.2.3-1


1. a source release
cmake-2.2.3-2-src.tar.bz2

cmake-2.2.3-2.patch  has cmake-2.2.3/CYGWIN-PATCHES/cmake.README cmake-2.2.3/CYGWIN-PATCHES/setup.hint
cmake-2.2.3-2.sh  -> script to create cygwin release
cmake-2.2.3.tar.bz2  -> unmodified cmake sources for 2.2.3





2 a binary release
cmake-2.2.3-2.tar.bz2

normal binary release with use as the root of the tree:

Here is the bootstrap command used:

  ${SOURCE_DIR}/bootstrap --prefix=/usr --datadir=/share/cmake-${VER} \
                          --docdir=/share/doc/cmake-${VER} --mandir=/share/man

CMAKE_DOC_DIR    /share/doc/${PKG}-${VER}
CMAKE_MAN_DIR    /share/man
CMAKE_DATA_DIR   /share/${PKG}-${VER}

Here is the directory stucture:
