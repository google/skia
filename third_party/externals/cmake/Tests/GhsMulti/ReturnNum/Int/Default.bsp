# Target description File for the Integrate utility for use with the
# INTEGRITY real-time operating system by Green Hills Software.
# Before editing this file, refer to your Integrate documentation.
# default.bsp is appropriate for INTEGRITY applications which are
# fully linked with the kernel (for RAM or ROM) or dynamically downloaded.
#
# MinimumAddress must match the value of .ramend in the linker directives
# file used for the KernelSpace program - see default.ld for more info.
# The MaximumAddress used here allows memory mappings to be specified
# for up to the 16 MB mark in RAM.   Intex will not permit programs
# that require more memory for its mappings.    If the board has less
# memory,  this number can be reduced by the user.
