^CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0053-WARN.cmake:2 \(message\):
  Policy CMP0053 is not set: Simplify variable reference and escape sequence
  evaluation.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0053" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For input:

    '\\'

  the old evaluation rules produce:

    '\\'

  but the new evaluation rules produce an error:

    Syntax error in cmake code at
      .*/Tests/RunCMake/Syntax/CMP0053-WARN.cmake:2
    when parsing string
      \\
    Invalid character escape '\\' \(at end of input\).

  Using the old result for compatibility since the policy is not set.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
