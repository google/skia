^CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0053-NUL.cmake:1 \(set\):
  Policy CMP0053 is not set: Simplify variable reference and escape sequence
  evaluation.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0053" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For input:

    '\\0'

  the old evaluation rules produce:

    ''

  but the new evaluation rules produce an error:

    Syntax error in cmake code at
      .*/Tests/RunCMake/Syntax/CMP0053-NUL.cmake:1
    when parsing string
      \\0
    Invalid character escape '\\0'.

  Using the old result for compatibility since the policy is not set.
