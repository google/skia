^CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0053-At-WARN-newlines.cmake:4 \(set\):
  Policy CMP0053 is not set: Simplify variable reference and escape sequence
  evaluation.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0053" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For input:

    '
    @var@
    '

  the old evaluation rules produce:

    '
    \${right}
    '

  but the new evaluation rules produce:

    '
    @var@
    '

  Using the old result for compatibility since the policy is not set.
