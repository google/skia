CMake Error in CMakeLists.txt:
  The COMPILE_FEATURES property of target "empty1" was evaluated when
  computing the link implementation, and the "CXX_STANDARD" was "98" for that
  computation.  Computing the COMPILE_FEATURES based on the link
  implementation resulted in a higher "CXX_STANDARD" "11".  This is not
  permitted.  The COMPILE_FEATURES may not both depend on and be depended on
  by the link implementation.
