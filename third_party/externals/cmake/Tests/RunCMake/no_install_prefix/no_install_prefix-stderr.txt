CMake Error at do_test.cmake:2 \(find_package\):
  By not providing "FindNoPrefix.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "NoPrefix",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "NoPrefix" with any
  of the following names:

    NoPrefixConfig.cmake
    noprefix-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "NoPrefix" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "NoPrefix_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "NoPrefix" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
