CMake Error at NoTarget.cmake:1 \(add_dependencies\):
  Cannot add target-level dependencies to non-existent target "foo".

  The add_dependencies works for top-level logical targets created by the
  add_executable, add_library, or add_custom_target commands.  If you want to
  add file-level dependencies see the DEPENDS option of the add_custom_target
  and add_custom_command commands.
