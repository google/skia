^CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0060-Common.cmake:[0-9]+ \(add_executable\):
  Policy CMP0060 is not set: Link libraries by full path even in implicit
  directories.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0060" for policy details.  Use
  the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Some library files are in directories implicitly searched by the linker
  when invoked for C:

   .*/Tests/RunCMake/CMP0060/CMP0060-WARN-ON-build/lib/(lib)?CMP0060.(a|lib)

  For compatibility with older versions of CMake, the generated link line
  will ask the linker to search for these by library name.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.$
