CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0023-WARN.cmake:9 \(target_link_libraries\):
  Policy CMP0023 is not set: Plain and keyword target_link_libraries
  signatures cannot be mixed.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0023" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  The plain signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "foo".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a target should
  be either all-keyword or all-plain.

  The uses of the plain signature are here:
