CMake Error in CMakeLists.txt:
  Property "SOMETHING" appears in both the COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL and the
  COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property in the dependencies of target "user".
  This is not allowed.  A property may only require compatibility in a
  boolean interpretation, a numeric minimum, a numeric maximum or a string
  interpretation, but not a mixture.
