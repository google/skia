CMake Warning \(dev\) at CMP0051-WARN.cmake:6 \(get_target_property\):
  Policy CMP0051 is not set: List TARGET_OBJECTS in SOURCES target property.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0051" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Target "empty" contains \$<TARGET_OBJECTS> generator expression in its
  sources list.  This content was not previously part of the SOURCES property
  when that property was read at configure time.  Code reading that property
  needs to be adapted to ignore the generator expression using the
  string\(GENEX_STRIP\) command.
Call Stack \(most recent call first\):
  CMakeLists.txt:3 \(include\)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
