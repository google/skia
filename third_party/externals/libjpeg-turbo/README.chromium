Description:
This consists of the components:
* A partial copy of libjpeg-turbo 1.3.1 (r1219);
* Revision r1188 cherry-picked from upstream trunk into config.h to fix
  compiler warning on newer versions of gcc;
* Revision r1220 cherry-picked from upstream trunk into jchuff.c to use
  clz/bsr instructions on ARM for bit counting rather than the lookup table
  (reduces memory footprint and can improve performance in some cases);
* Revisions r1108, r1109, r1333, r1375, r1386, r1389 and r1390 cherry-picked
  from upstream trunk for Arm64 NEON SIMD support;
* Revisions r1582, r1583, r1586, r1587, r1591, and
  commit 91eceba0a132a3fc70388a82c75616e67725a93a (code moved to GitHub)
  cherry-picked from upstream trunk for partial decoding optimization;
  http://crbug.com/515694
* Revisions r1295, r1385, r1398, and r1402 (r1386 is also required but has
  already been cherry-picked) cherry-picked from upstream trunk to enable
  decoding to 565 as a memory optimization;
  http://crbug.com/516761
* A build file (libjpeg.gyp), and;
* Patched header files used by Chromium.

This libjpeg-turbo can replace our libjpeg-6b without any modifications in the
Chromium code.

Same as our copy of libjpeg-6b, this libjpeg-turbo also added a new file
jpeglibmangler.h and included it from jpeglib.h that changes the names of all
externally visible functions to chromium_* so that we can avoid conflicts that
arise when system libraries attempt to use our libjpeg. Also, we applied the
following changes which are not merged to upstream:

* Added the 'private_extern' flags on Mac (or the 'hidden' flags on Linux) to
  all the global symbols in '.asm' files to prevent making them external ones.
* Supported motion-JPEG frames that do not have DHT markers.
* Fix libjpeg_turbo svn r64 libjpeg6b compat issue: make the fast path Huffman
  decoder fallback to slow decoding if the Huffman decoding bit sentinel > 16,
  this to match the exact behavior of jpeg_huff_decode().

* Fixed an issue with the ARM NEON build.
