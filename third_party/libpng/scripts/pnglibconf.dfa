file pnglibconf.h scripts/pnglibconf.dfa PNGLCONF_H

# This file is preprocessed by scripts/options.awk and the
# C compiler to generate 'pnglibconf.h' - a list of all the
# configuration options.  The file lists the various options
# that can *only* be specified during the libpng build;
# pnglibconf.h freezes the definitons selected for the specific
# build.
#
# The syntax is detailed in scripts/options.awk, this is a summary
# only:
#
# setting <name> [requires ...] [default]
#    #define PNG_<name> <value>  /* value comes from current setting */
# option <name> [requires ...] [if ...] [enables ...] [disabled]
#    #define PNG_<name>_SUPPORTED if the requirements are met and
#    enable the other options listed
# chunk <name> [requires ...] [disabled]
#    Enable chunk processing for the given ancillary chunk
#
# Note that the 'on' and 'off' keywords, while valid on both option
# and chunk, should not be used in this file because they force the
# relevant options on or off.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------

# The following setting, option and chunk values can all be changed
# while building libpng:
# 
# setting: change 'setting' lines to fine tune library performance,
#   changes to the settings don't affect the libpng API functionally
#
# option: change 'option' lines to remove or add capabilities from
#   or to the library; options change the library API
#
# chunk: change 'chunk' lines to remove capabilities to process
#   optional ('ancillary') chunks.  This does not prevent PNG
#   decoding but does change the libpng API because some chunks
#   will be ignored.
#
# There are three ways of disabling features, in no particular order:
#
# 1) Create 'pngusr.h', enter the required private build information
# detailed below and #define PNG_NO_<option> for each option you
# don't want in that file in that file.  You can also turn on options
# using PNG_<option>_SUPPORTED.  When you have finished rerun
# configure and rebuild pnglibconf.h file with -DPNG_USER_CONFIG:
# 
#  make clean
#  CPPFLAGS='-DPNG_USER_CONFIG' ./configure
#  make pnglibconf.h
#
# pngusr.h is only used during the creation of pnglibconf.h, but it
# is safer to ensure that -DPNG_USER_CONFIG is specified throughout
# the build by changing the CPPFLAGS passed to the initial ./configure
#
# 2) Add definitions of the settings you want to change to
# CPPFLAGS; for example:
# 
#   -DPNG_DEFAULT_READ_MACROS=0
#
# (This would change the default to *not* use read macros.)  Be
# very careful to change only settings that don't alter the API
# because this approach bypasses the private build checking.  You
# can also change settings from pngpriv.h (read pngpriv.h) safely
# without API changes.  Do that in the same way.
#
# 3) Write a new '.dfa' file (say 'pngusr.dfa') and in this file
# provide override values for setting entries and turn option or
# chunk values explicitly 'on' or 'off':
#
#    setting FOO default VALUE
#    option BAR [on|off]
#
# Then add this file to the options.awk command line (the *first*
# one) after this file.  The make macro DFA_XTRA is provided to make
# this easier (set it like CPPFLAGS prior to running ./configure).
# Look at the builds below contrib/pngminim for some extreme examples
# of how this can be used.
#
# Don't edit this file unless you are contributing a patch to
# libpng and need new or modified options/settings.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

# The following causes commented out #undef lines to be written to
# pnglibconf.h; this can be stopped by logunsupported=0 in a later
# file or on the command line (after pnglibconf.dfa)

logunsupported = 1

# PNG_USER_CONFIG has to be defined on the compiler command line
# to cause pngusr.h to be read while constructing pnglibconf.h
#
# If you create a private DLL you need to define the following
# macros in the file 'pngusr.h' and set -DPNG_USER_CONFIG for
# compilation (i.e. in CFLAGS.)
# #define PNG_USER_PRIVATEBUILD \
#     <Describes by whom and why this version of the DLL was built>
#  e.g. #define PNG_USER_PRIVATEBUILD "Build by MyCompany for xyz reasons."
# #define PNG_USER_DLLFNAME_POSTFIX <two-letter postfix that serve to
#        distinguish your DLL from those of the official release. These
#        correspond to the trailing letters that come after the version
#        number and must match your private DLL name>
#  e.g. // private DLL "libpng13gx.dll"
#       #define PNG_USER_DLLFNAME_POSTFIX "gx"
#
# The following macros are also at your disposal if you want to complete the
# DLL VERSIONINFO structure.
# - PNG_USER_VERSIONINFO_COMMENTS
# - PNG_USER_VERSIONINFO_COMPANYNAME
# - PNG_USER_VERSIONINFO_LEGALTRADEMARKS

# This is a special fixup for the Watcom C compiler on Windows, which has
# multiple procedure call standards.  Unless PNG_API_RULE is set explicitly
# (i.e. if it is not defined at this point) it will be forced to '2' here when
# using Watcom.  This indicates to the other header files that Watcom behaviour
# is required where appropriate.

# Default to using the read macros

setting DEFAULT_READ_MACROS default 1

# The alternative is to call functions to read PNG values, if
# the functions are turned *off* the read macros must always
# be enabled, so turning this off will actually force the
# USE_READ_MACROS option on (see pngconf.h)

option READ_INT_FUNCTIONS requires READ

# The same for write, but these can only be switched off if
# no writing is required at all - hence the use of an 'enables'
# not a 'requires' below:

option WRITE_INT_FUNCTIONS disabled
option WRITE enables WRITE_INT_FUNCTIONS

# Generic options - affect both read and write.

option WARNINGS
option BENIGN_ERRORS
option MNG_FEATURES

# Arithmetic options, the first is the big switch that chooses between internal
# floating and fixed point arithmetic implementations - it does not affect any
# APIs.  The second two (the _POINT settings) switch off individual APIs.

option FLOATING_ARITHMETIC
option FLOATING_POINT enables ok_math
option FIXED_POINT enables ok_math

# Added at libpng version 1.4.0 

option ERROR_TEXT

# The following is always on (defined empty) 

setting CALLOC_SUPPORTED default

# This protects us against compilers that run on a windowing system
# and thus don't have or would rather us not use the stdio types:
# stdin, stdout, and stderr.  The only one currently used is stderr
# in png_error() and png_warning().  #defining PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO will
# prevent these from being compiled and used. #defining PNG_NO_STDIO
# will also prevent these, plus will prevent the entire set of stdio
# macros and functions (FILE *, printf, etc.) from being compiled and used,
# unless (PNG_DEBUG > 0) has been #defined.

option STDIO
option CONSOLE_IO requires STDIO

# Note: prior to 1.5.0 this option could not be disabled if STDIO
# was enabled.

option ERROR_NUMBERS disabled

# If this is disabled it is not possible for apps to get the

#option READ_BIG_ENDIAN disabled

# Allow users to control limits on what the READ code will
# read:

# Added at libpng-1.2.43; adds limit fields to png_struct,

# You can remove these capabilities safely and still be PNG
# conformant, however the library that results is still non-standard.
# See the comments above about how to change options and settings.

# READ options

option READ enables READ_INTERLACING

# Disabling READ_16BIT does not disable reading 16-bit PNG files, but it

# The size of the png_text structure changed in libpng-1.0.6 when
# iTXt support was added.  iTXt support was turned off by default through

#
# BUILD TIME ONLY OPTIONS
#   These options do not affect the API but rather alter how the

#   can't be changed by the application.

# Check the correctness of cHRM chunks

option CHECK_cHRM requires cHRM

#
# Artificially align memory - the code typically aligns to 8 byte

# BUILD TIME SETTINGS
# Like build time options these do not affect the API, but they
# may be useful to applications because they record details of
# how the API will behave particularly with regard to overall
# accuracy.

setting MAX_GAMMA_8 default 11

# This controls how much a difference in gamma we can tolerate before
# we actually start doing gamma conversion, it's a fixed point value,

# This is the size of the compression buffer, and thus the size of
# an IDAT chunk.  Make this whatever size you feel is best for your
# machine.  One of these will be allocated per png_struct.  When this
# is full, it writes the data to the disk, and does some other
# calculations.  Making this an extremely small size may slow
# the library down, but you may want to experiment to determine
# where it becomes significant, if you are concerned with memory
# usage.  Note that zlib allocates at least 32Kb also.  For readers,
# this describes the size of the buffer available to read the data in.
# Unless this gets smaller than the size of a row (compressed),
# it should not make much difference how big this is.
