GrGlInterface Autogeneration
============================

Background
----------

At a high level, the first three steps of making a GrGLInterface (a generic way to
interact with a GL-like GPU) are:

  - Assemble: Copy a set of function pointers into the struct
  - Validate: Make sure the function pointers advertised actually exist.
  - Capabilities: Compute what fast/slow paths are enabled based on the functions
        in the struct (GrGLCaps, for short)

Autogeneration
--------------

The first two steps have been automated with a table-based generation script located
in this folder. The table is in JSON5 format (like JSON, but with comments). O

Once edited, the Assemble/Validate code can be re-generated by running
`make generate` in this folder.
