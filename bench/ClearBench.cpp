// This benchmark attempts to measure the time to do a fullscreen clear, an axis-aligned partial
// clear, and a clear restricted to an axis-aligned rounded rect. The fullscreen and axis-aligned
// partial clears on the GPU should follow a fast path that maps to backend-specialized clear
// operations, whereas the rounded-rect clear cannot be.
