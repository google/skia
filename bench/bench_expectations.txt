# File for specifying expected Skia benchmark values and ranges.
# Currently the file is manually created/edited for adapting to bench changes.
#
# The format of each data line (non-empty, not started with "#") is:
# <BenchType_BitmapConfig_TimerType>,<Platform-Alg>,<Expected>,<LB>,<UB>
# Where Alg is the bench value representation algorithm: min, avg, 25th, etc.
# LB and UB are lower and upper bounds for the range of the bench value.
#
# Note: unrecognized data lines (not exactly 4 commas, unparsable bench values)
# will likely raise exceptions.
