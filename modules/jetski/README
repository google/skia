JetSki is an AAR, or Android Library, that compiles Skia's native code, 
JNI bindings, and Java wrapper classes into a shared library.

BUILDING

1) Through Android Studio
-  Start a project by opening skia/platform_tools/android/apps with Android Studio.
-  Ensure that you're local.properties file is filled out with paths to your 
   Skia out directories. It should look like this:

   sdk.dir=[sdk file path]
   depot_tools.dir=[depot tools file path]
   x86.out.dir=[out file for x86]
   x64.out.dir=[out file for x64]
   arm64.out.dir=[out file for xarm64]
   arm.out.dir=[out file for arm]

-  Click on JetSki on the project tree, click Build in the toolbar, and select
   " Make Module 'apps.jetski' "
-  The AAR will be under the build/outputs/aar directory.

2) Through the terminal
-  Run: platform_tools/android/bin/android_build_app -C  out/[out_dir] jetski
-  If it builds with no errors, youâ€™ll find the AAR in the out directory you were building from


LOADING

Before using JetSki classes, client applications must explicitly load the native library.
This is usually accomplished via a static class initializer, e.g.

  public class MyApp {
      static {
          System.loadLibrary("jetski");
      }

      ...
  }
