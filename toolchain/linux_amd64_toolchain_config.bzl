"""
This file specifies a clang toolchain that can run on a Linux host which doesn't depend on any
installed packages from the host machine.

See download_linux_amd64_toolchain.bzl for more details on the creation of the toolchain.

It uses the usr subfolder of the built toolchain as a sysroot

It follows the example of:

 - https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk/blob/7f39d100d8cd207094decea907121df72065517e/bazel/emscripten_toolchain/crosstool.bzl
