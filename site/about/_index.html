  <p class="h3 mt-5">
    Skia is an open source 2D graphics library which provides common APIs that
    work across a variety of hardware and software platforms. It serves as the
    graphics engine for Google Chrome and ChromeOS, Android, Flutter, and many
    other products. Skia is sponsored and managed by Google, but is available
    for use by anyone under the BSD Free Software License. While engineering of
    the core components is done by the Skia development team, we consider
    contributions from any source.
